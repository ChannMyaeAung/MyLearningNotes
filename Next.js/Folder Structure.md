### Folder Descriptions:

- **`app/`**: this folder contains routes, components, layouts, and page structure.
- **`components/`**: Store all the reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, modals, forms).
- **`hooks/`**: For custom React hooks. These can be specific hooks for API data fetching, UI interactions, or other side effects.
- **`services/`**: Business logic or API interaction functions. This separates concerns, making the codebase more maintainable.
- **`lib/`**: Any general-purpose utilities or helper methods that can be used across the application.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files for things like environment variables or constants. This could also include API client configuration files like Axios setup.
- **`context/`**: Global state management through React Context API, such as for authentication or theme management.
- **`store/`**: If using a state management library like Redux or Zustand, this is where all the store slices or state logic resides.
- **`middlewares/`**: Middlewares for server-side logic (e.g., authentication, API request validation).
- **`types/`**: TypeScript interfaces and types to ensure strong typing across the application. These can be specific to API models or business logic.
- **`utils/`**: General utility functions such as formatters, validators, or API utility functions to keep code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
- **`assets/`**: Static resources like images, fonts, or media that aren’t directly related to components but are shared across the application.
- **`tests/`**: Test-related folders for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Can be categorized by components, pages, or utilities.
- **`locales/`**: Files for managing translations if your app supports multiple languages.
- **`public/`**: Stores publicly accessible files like `favicon.ico`, `robots.txt`, images, or any other static assets that don't need to go through Webpack processing.

### Key Points:

- **Modularity**: Keep concerns separated by grouping related logic into distinct folders (e.g., components, hooks, services).
- **Scalability**: The folder structure allows the application to scale by isolating and organizing business logic, utilities, and services.
- **Flexibility**: Hot-swappable elements (services, types, contexts) allow easy maintenance and updates to individual parts of the app.
