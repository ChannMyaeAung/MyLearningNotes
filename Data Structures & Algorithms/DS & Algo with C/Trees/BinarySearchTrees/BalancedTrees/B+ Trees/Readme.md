# Understanding B⁺ Trees

A B⁺ Tree is an extension of the B-Tree data structure. While both are balanced and multi-way trees, B⁺ Trees differ in how they store data and manage their nodes. Specifically:

- **All data records are stored at the leaf nodes.**
- **Internal nodes only store keys and child pointers.**
- **Leaf nodes are linked together in a linked list to facilitate range queries and ordered traversals.**

These characteristics make B⁺ Trees particularly suitable for scenarios requiring efficient range queries and sequential access.

# 2. Properties of B⁺ Trees

Before diving into the implementation, it's essential to understand the defining properties of B⁺ Trees:

1. **Balanced Structure:**
   - All leaf nodes are at the same depth.
   - Ensures consistent performance for all operations.
2. **Order of the Tree (`m`):**
   - Defines the maximum number of children a node can have.
   - A B⁺ Tree of order `m` can have a maximum of `m` children and `m-1` keys per internal node.
3. **Node Capacity:**
   - Internal Nodes:
     - Minimum number of keys: `⌈m/2⌉ - 1`
     - Maximum number of keys: `m - 1`
   - Leaf Nodes:
     - Similar to internal nodes regarding the number of keys.
     - Additionally, each leaf node contains pointers to the next (and optionally previous) leaf nodes.
4. **Data Storage:**
   - **Internal Nodes:** Store only keys and child pointers.
   - **Leaf Nodes:** Store keys and associated data pointers (or the data itself).
5. **Linked Leaf Nodes:**
   - Leaf nodes are linked together to allow efficient range queries and ordered traversals.
6. **Key Duplication:**
   - In B⁺ Trees, keys are duplicated in internal nodes to guide the search process, but actual data resides only in the leaves.

# 3. B⁺ Tree Structure in C

To implement a B⁺ Tree in C, we need to define the structure of internal and leaf nodes. Below is a basic structure using C structs.

### **Definitions:**

- **Order (`M`):** Maximum number of children per node.
- **Minimum Degree (`T`):** Minimum number of keys per node (typically `ceil(M/2) - 1`).

### **Structs:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

#define M 4 // Example order (maximum children)

typedef struct BPTreeNode {
    bool is_leaf;
    int num_keys;
    int keys[M - 1]; // Maximum keys
    struct BPTreeNode* children[M]; // Pointers to child nodes
    // For leaf nodes
    struct BPTreeNode* next; // Pointer to next leaf
    // Data pointers can be added here if storing data
} BPTreeNode;

// Function to create a new node
BPTreeNode* create_node(bool is_leaf) {
    BPTreeNode* node = (BPTreeNode*)malloc(sizeof(BPTreeNode));
    node->is_leaf = is_leaf;
    node->num_keys = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        node->children[i] = NULL;
    }
    node->next = NULL;
    return node;
}
```

**Notes:**

- **`is_leaf`:** Indicates whether the node is a leaf.
- **`num_keys`:** Current number of keys in the node.
- **`keys`:** Array to store keys. Size is `M - 1` because a node with `M` children has `M - 1` keys.
- **`children`:** Array of child pointers. For leaf nodes, this can store data pointers instead.
- **`next`:** Pointer to the next leaf node (used only in leaf nodes).

------

# 4. Key Operations in B⁺ Trees

Implementing a B⁺ Tree involves handling several operations, primarily search, insertion, and deletion. Here's an overview of each:

### **4.1 Search**

The search operation navigates from the root to the appropriate leaf node by traversing internal nodes based on key comparisons.

**Algorithm:**

1. Start at the root node.
2. For each internal node:
   - Perform a binary search or linear search on the keys to find the correct child pointer.
   - Move to the child node.
3. Once a leaf node is reached, search for the key within the leaf's keys.
4. If found, return the associated data; otherwise, indicate that the key does not exist.

**Implementation:**

```c
BPTreeNode* search(BPTreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == NULL) return NULL;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < root->num_keys && key > root->keys[i]) {
        i++;
    }
    if (root->is_leaf) {
        // Search within the leaf node
        for(int j = 0; j < root->num_keys; j++) {
            if(root->keys[j] == key) {
                return root; // Key found
            }
        }
        return NULL; // Key not found
    } else {
        return search(root->children[i], key);
    }
}
```

### **4.2 Insertion**

Insertion involves:

1. Finding the Correct Leaf Node:
   - Similar to the search operation.
2. Inserting the Key:
   - Insert the key in the correct sorted position within the leaf node.
3. Handling Node Overflow:
   - If the leaf node exceeds the maximum number of keys, split the node.
   - Promote the middle key to the parent node.
   - Recursively handle splits up the tree, potentially creating a new root.

**Implementation:**

Simplified version:

```c
// Function to insert a key into a leaf node
void insert_into_leaf(BPTreeNode* leaf, int key) {
    int i = leaf->num_keys - 1;
    // Find the position to insert the new key
    while (i >= 0 && leaf->keys[i] > key) {
        leaf->keys[i + 1] = leaf->keys[i];
        i--;
    }
    leaf->keys[i + 1] = key;
    leaf->num_keys++;
}

// Function to split a leaf node
BPTreeNode* split_leaf(BPTreeNode* leaf, int* new_key) {
    BPTreeNode* new_leaf = create_node(true);
    int mid = (M + 1) / 2;
    new_leaf->num_keys = leaf->num_keys - mid;
    // Move half the keys to the new leaf
    for(int i = 0; i < new_leaf->num_keys; i++) {
        new_leaf->keys[i] = leaf->keys[mid + i];
    }
    leaf->num_keys = mid;
    // Update leaf links
    new_leaf->next = leaf->next;
    leaf->next = new_leaf;
    // The first key of the new leaf is promoted
    *new_key = new_leaf->keys[0];
    return new_leaf;
}

// Function to insert a key into the B+ Tree
BPTreeNode* insert(BPTreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == NULL) {
        root = create_node(true);
        root->keys[0] = key;
        root->num_keys = 1;
        return root;
    }
    
    // Find the leaf node
    BPTreeNode* leaf = root;
    while (!leaf->is_leaf) {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < leaf->num_keys && key > leaf->keys[i]) {
            i++;
        }
        leaf = leaf->children[i];
    }
    
    // Insert the key into the leaf node
    insert_into_leaf(leaf, key);
    
    // Check for overflow
    if (leaf->num_keys == M) {
        int new_key;
        BPTreeNode* new_leaf = split_leaf(leaf, &new_key);
        // Insert the new key into the parent
        // This requires implementing a function to handle parent insertion
        // For simplicity, assume we have a function called insert_into_parent
        // root = insert_into_parent(root, leaf, new_key, new_leaf);
        // Implementing insert_into_parent is complex and beyond this scope
    }
    
    return root;
}
```

**Notes:**

- The `insert` function currently handles only inserting into leaf nodes and splitting them. To fully handle insertion, you need to implement `insert_into_parent`, which manages inserting the promoted key into the parent node and handling potential splits recursively.

### **4.3 Deletion**

Deletion involves:

1. **Finding the Key:**
   - Similar to the search operation.
2. **Removing the Key:**
   - Delete the key from the leaf node.
3. **Handling Node Underflow:**
   - If the node has fewer keys than the minimum required, attempt to redistribute keys from sibling nodes.
   - If redistribution is not possible, merge the node with a sibling.
   - Recursively handle underflows up the tree, potentially reducing the tree's height.

**Implementation:**

Deletion in B⁺ Trees is intricate. Here's a high-level overview without code:

1. **Locate the Leaf Node:**
   - Traverse the tree to find the leaf node containing the key.
2. **Remove the Key:**
   - Delete the key from the leaf node and shift remaining keys.
3. **Check for Underflow:**
   - If the leaf has fewer than `ceil(M/2) - 1` keys, attempt to borrow a key from a sibling.
4. **Merge if Necessary:**
   - If borrowing is not possible, merge the node with a sibling and adjust the parent node accordingly.
5. **Adjust the Tree:**
   - Update internal nodes to reflect any changes in keys due to merging or borrowing.

# Conclusion

B⁺ Trees are efficient and scalable data structures ideal for applications requiring fast search, insertion, deletion, and especially range queries. Their structure, where all data resides in leaf nodes linked together, allows for efficient sequential access and minimizes disk I/O operations, making them a popular choice for database indexing and file systems.
