## Balanced Trees

A **balanced tree** is a type of binary search tree (BST) where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is constrained. This balance ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced, providing efficient operation times—typically **O(log n)** for search, insertion, and deletion—where **n** is the number of nodes in the tree.

In contrast, an unbalanced BST can degrade to a linked list in the worst case, leading to **O(n)** operation times.

### **Why Balance Matters**

- **Efficiency:** Balanced trees maintain a low height, ensuring that operations remain fast.
- **Predictability:** The performance of balanced trees is more consistent, avoiding worst-case scenarios.
- **Scalability:** They handle large datasets effectively, making them suitable for databases, file systems, and other applications requiring efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

### Types of Balanced Trees

Several types of balanced trees exist, each with its own balancing criteria and use cases. The most common balanced trees include:

#### **a. AVL Trees**

- **Definition:** Named after inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis, AVL trees are height-balanced binary search trees.
- **Balancing Criteria:** For every node, the height difference between its left and right subtrees (balance factor) is at most **1**.
- **Operations:** Ensure balance through rotations during insertions and deletions.
- **Use Cases:** Situations requiring frequent lookups and insertions, such as in-memory databases.

#### **b. Red-Black Trees**

- **Definition:** A type of self-balancing BST where each node has an extra bit for denoting the color of the node, either red or black.
- Balancing Criteria:
  - Each node is either red or black.
  - The root is always black.
  - Red nodes cannot have red children (no two reds in a row).
  - Every path from a node to its descendant NULL nodes has the same number of black nodes.
- **Operations:** Maintain balance through color changes and rotations.
- **Use Cases:** Widely used in language libraries (e.g., C++ STL's `map` and `set`) due to their good balance between insertion/deletion and lookup operations.

#### **c. Other Balanced Trees**

- **Splay Trees:** Self-adjusting trees with amortized **O(log n)** operations, where recently accessed elements are quick to access again.
- **B-Trees and B+ Trees:** Balanced trees optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data, commonly used in databases and filesystems.
- **Treaps:** Combination of binary search trees and heaps, maintaining both BST and heap properties.
