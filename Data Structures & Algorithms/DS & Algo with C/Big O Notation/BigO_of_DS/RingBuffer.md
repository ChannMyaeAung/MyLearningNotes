### Ring Buffer

| Operation                          | Time Complexity |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Enqueue (Add an element)           | O(1)            |
| Dequeue (Remove an element)        | O(1)            |
| Peek/Front (View first element)    | O(1)            |
| IsFull (Check if buffer is full)   | O(1)            |
| IsEmpty (Check if buffer is empty) | O(1)            |
| Access by Index                    | O(1)            |
