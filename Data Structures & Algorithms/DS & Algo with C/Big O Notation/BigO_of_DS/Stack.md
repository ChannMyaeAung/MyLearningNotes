### **Stack**

A **stack** is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. It supports operations primarily at one end called the "top."

**Common Operations:**

- Push (Add an element to the top):
  - **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- Pop (Remove the top element):
  - **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- Peek/Top (View the top element without removing it):
  - **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- isEmpty (Check if the stack is empty):
  - **Time Complexity:** O(1)

**Implementation Notes:**

- Typically implemented using dynamic arrays (like Python lists) or linked lists.
- Both array-based and linked list-based implementations offer constant time complexity for the primary operations.
