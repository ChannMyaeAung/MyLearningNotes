# Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

- Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a greedy approach (an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment. It doesn't worry whether the current best result will bring the overall optimal result) for calculating the maximum possible flow in a network or a graph.

- A term, **flow network**, is used to describe a network of vertices and edges with a source (S) and a sink (T). 
  - Each vertex, except **S** and **T**, can receive and send an equal amount of stuff through it. **S** can only send and **T** can only receive stuff.

## Terminologies Used

#### Augmenting Path

It is the path available in a flow network.

#### Residual Graph

It represents the flow network that has additional possible flow.

#### Residual Capacity

It is the capacity of the edge after subtracting the flow from the maximum capacity.
