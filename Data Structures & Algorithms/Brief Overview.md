# Brief Overview of Data Structures & Algorithms



## What are Data Structures?

- Think of data structures as containers that hold and organize in a way that makes it efficient to access and manipulate.
- Different data structures are suited for different tasks.

1. **Arrays**: A collection of elements stored contiguously in memory. 
   - Great for simple lists and accessing elements quickly by their index.
2. **Linked Lists**: Elements are stored as nodes, each containing data and a pointer to the next node. 
   - Useful for dynamic data where we need to insert or delete elements frequently.
3. **Stacks**: Follows the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle, like a stack of plates. 
   - Useful for function calls, undo/redo operations and expression evaluation.
4. **Queues**: Follows the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle, like a line at a store.
   - Useful for managing tasks, buffering data streams, and breadth-first search algorithms.
5. **Trees**: Hierarchical structures with a root node and branches connecting child nodes. 
   - Great for representing hierarchical relationships, searching, and sorting data.
6. **Graphs**: Represent relationships between objects using nodes and edges. 
   - Useful for modelling networks, maps and social connections.

## What are Algorithms?

- Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or sets of instructions for solving a specific problem. 
- They work on data structures to perform tasks like searching, sorting, inserting, deleting, and traversing.

### Fundamental Algorithm concepts

1. **Searching**: Finding a specific element in a data structure. (e.g., linear search, binary search).
2. **Sorting**: Arranging elements in a specific order (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort).
3. **Recursion**: Solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems of the same type.
4. **Dynamic Programming**: Optimizing recursive algorithms by storing intermediate results to avoid redundant computations.
5. **Graph Algorithms**: Algorithms for traversing graphs, finding shortest paths and detecting cycles (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm).
