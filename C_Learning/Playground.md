### `strcspn()`

The `strcspn` function in C is part of the C standard library, declared in the `<string.h>` header file. It computes the length of the initial segment of the first string (`str1`) which consists entirely of characters not in the second string (`str2`). In other words, it searches for the first occurrence of any character from `str2` in `str1` and returns the number of characters in `str1` before this first occurrence.

Here's the prototype for `strcspn`:

```C
size_t strcspn(const char *str1, const char *str2);
```

#### Detailed Explanation

- **Parameters:**
  - `const char *str1`: A pointer to the null-terminated string to be scanned.
  - `const char *str2`: A pointer to the null-terminated string containing the characters to match.
- **Return Value:**
  - The function returns the number of characters in the initial segment of `str1` which are not in `str2`. If `str1` does not contain any character from `str2`, the function returns the length of `str1`.

#### Example

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    const char *str1 = "hello, world";
    const char *str2 = "o,";
    
    size_t len = strcspn(str1, str2);
    
    printf("The length of the initial segment of str1 not containing any character from str2 is: %zu\n", len);
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of the Example

- `str1` is `"hello, world"`.
- `str2` is `"o,"`.

The function `strcspn` will scan `str1` and stop at the first occurrence of any character that appears in `str2`.

- The first character in `str1` that matches any character in `str2` is `o`, which is at index 4.

So, the output of this program will be:

```C
The length of the initial segment of str1 not containing any character from str2 is: 4
```

#### Use Cases

- **Parsing strings**: When you need to find the length of a segment in a string that does not include certain delimiter characters.
- **Validation**: Checking for the presence of any invalid characters in an input string up to a certain point.

`strcspn` is a useful function for various string processing tasks where identifying non-matching segments is required.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "practice.h"

int name_length(char *name);

int main()
{
    char name[25];
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    fgets(name, 25, stdin);
    name[strcspn(name, "\n")] = '\0';
    printf("Your name is %d characters long.\n", name_length(name));
    return 0;
}

int name_length(char *name)
{
    int i = 0;
    while (name[i] != '\0')
    {
        i++;
    }
    return i;
} 
```

In this code, the `strcspn` function is used to remove the newline character (`'\n'`) that `fgets` includes when the user presses Enter. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what `strcspn` does in this context:

1. **Reading User Input**:

   ```C
   fgets(name, 25, stdin);
   ```

   This line reads up to 24 characters from the standard input (stdin) and stores them in the `name` array. The `fgets` function also stores a newline character (`'\n'`) at the end of the input if there is space available in the buffer.

2. **Removing the Newline Character**:

   ```C
   name[strcspn(name, "\n")] = '\0';
   ```

   - `strcspn(name, "\n")` calculates the length of the initial segment of `name` that does not contain the newline character (`'\n'`).
   - If a newline character is found in the `name` string, `strcspn` returns the index of this newline character.
   - This index is then used to place a null terminator (`'\0'`) at that position in the `name` string, effectively removing the newline character and terminating the string.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the steps in context:

#### Detailed Steps:

1. **User Input**:
   - Assume the user types "John Doe" and presses Enter.
   - `fgets` will store `"John Doe\n"` in the `name` array.
2. **Using `strcspn` to Find Newline**:
   - `strcspn(name, "\n")` finds the index of the newline character.
   - For the input `"John Doe\n"`, `strcspn` returns `8` because the newline character is at the 8th position (0-based index).
3. **Replacing Newline with Null Terminator**:
   - `name[8] = '\0';` changes the newline character to a null terminator.
   - Now `name` contains `"John Doe"` without the newline character.

#### Summary:

In this code, `strcspn` is used to determine the position of the newline character that `fgets` adds at the end of the input. By replacing this newline with a null terminator, the code ensures that the `name` string is correctly terminated, allowing accurate calculation of its length and proper handling of the string in subsequent operations.

### Fibonacci Sequence

```C
#include <stdio.h>

void printFibonacci(int n){
    int t1 = 0, t2 = 1, nextTerm;
    
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        if(i == n){
            printf("%d\n", t1); // Print the last term without a comma
        } else{
            printf("%d, ", t1); // Print the terms with a comma
        }
        nextTerm = t1 + t2;
        t1 = t2;
        t2 = nextTerm;
    }
}

int main(){
    int n;
    
    printf("Enter the number of terms: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    printFibonacci(n);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Function Declaration**:

   ```C
   void printFibonacci(int n) {
   ```

   - The function `printFibonacci` takes an integer `n` as an argument, which represents the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to be printed.
   - The return type is `void` because the function does not return any value; it only prints the sequence.

2. **Variable Initialization**:

   ```C
   int t1 = 0, t2 = 1, nextTerm;
   ```

   - `t1` and `t2` are initialized to the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence (0 and 1, respectively).
   - `nextTerm` will be used to store the next term in the sequence.

3. **Print Statement**:

   ```C
   printf("Fibonacci Sequence: ");
   ```

   - This prints the label "Fibonacci Sequence: " to the console.

4. **For Loop**:

   ```C
   for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
   ```

   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`, iterating `n` times to print `n` terms of the sequence.

5. **Conditional Printing**:

   ```C
   if (i == n) {
       printf("%d", t1); // Print the last term without a comma
   } else {
       printf("%d, ", t1); // Print the term with a comma
   }
   ```

   - Inside the loop, there is a conditional check to determine if the current term is the last one (`i == n`).
   - If it is the last term, it prints `t1` without a comma.
   - Otherwise, it prints `t1` followed by a comma and a space.

6. **Update Terms**:

   ```C
   nextTerm = t1 + t2;
   t1 = t2;
   t2 = nextTerm;
   ```

   - These lines update the values of `t1` and `t2` for the next iteration.
   - `nextTerm` is calculated as the sum of `t1` and `t2`.
   - `t1` is then updated to the value of `t2`.
   - `t2` is updated to the value of `nextTerm`.

### 2D Arrays in C

- An array, where each element is an entire array
- Useful if we need a matrix, grid, or table of data

`main.c`

```C
int main(){
    int numbers[2][3] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}};
    
    // Setting each value in a 2D array
    // Same as above
    numbers[0][0] = 1;
    numbers[0][1] = 2;
    numbers[0][2] = 3;
    numbers[1][0] = 4;
    numbers[1][1] = 5;
    numbers[1][2] = 6;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++){
        for(int j = 0; j < 3; j++){
            printf("%d", numbers[i][j]);
        }
        // New line for each row
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

`Code Execution`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
```



#### Making our 2D array demonstration code a bit more flexible

`main.c`

```C
int main()
{
    int numbers[2][3];

    // Calculate the number of rows in the array
    int rows = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]);
    
  	// Cal;culate the number of columns in the array
    int columns = sizeof(numbers[0]) / sizeof(numbers[0][0]);

    printf("rows: %d\n", rows);
    printf("columns: %d\n", columns);

    numbers[0][0] = 1;
    numbers[0][1] = 2;
    numbers[0][2] = 3;
    numbers[1][0] = 4;
    numbers[1][1] = 5;
    numbers[1][2] = 6;
	
    // Nested for loop to iterate over the 2D array
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++)
        {
            // Print each element of the array
            printf("%d ", numbers[i][j]);
        }
        // print a newline for each row
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

- The way nested for loops work is that according to the above example, if i = 0, we are going to calculate `j` `columns` times (in this case 3 times);
- So it's going to be like this:

```
// i = 0 , j = 0
// i = 0, j = 1
// i = 0, j = 2

// i = 1, j = 0
// i = 1, j = 1
// i = 1, j = 2
```

#### Code Explanation

```C 
int numbers[2][3];
```



- This declares a 2D array named `numbers` with 2 rows and 3 columns.

```C
int rows = sizeof(numbers) / sizeof(numbers[0]);
```

- `sizeof(numbers)` gives the total size in bytes of the entire 2D array.
- `sizeof(numbers[0])` gives the size in bytes of the first row of the array.
- Dividing the total size of the array by the size of one row gives the number of rows.

```C
int columns = sizeof(numbers[0]) / sizeof(numbers[0][0]);
```

- `sizeof(numbers[0])` gives the size in bytes of the first row of the array.
- `sizeof(numbers[0][0])` gives the size in bytes of the first element of the first row.
- Dividing the size of one row by the size of one element gives the number of columns.

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Calculating Rows:**
   - `sizeof(numbers)` returns the total size of the array. For a 2x3 array of `int` (assuming `int` is 4 bytes), this would be `2 * 3 * 4 = 24` bytes.
   - `sizeof(numbers[0])` returns the size of the first row. For a row with 3 `int` elements, this would be `3 * 4 = 12` bytes.
   - Dividing these values gives `24 / 12 = 2`, which is the number of rows.
2. **Calculating Columns:**
   - `sizeof(numbers[0])` returns the size of the first row, which is `12` bytes.
   - `sizeof(numbers[0][0])` returns the size of a single `int` element, which is `4` bytes.
   - Dividing these values gives `12 / 4 = 3`, which is the number of columns.

### Summary

- The number of rows is calculated by dividing the total size of the array by the size of one row.
- The number of columns is calculated by dividing the size of one row by the size of one element.

This method is useful because it dynamically calculates the dimensions of the array, making the code more flexible and less error-prone.

### Leap Year Program

A leap year (in the Gregorian calendar) occurs:

- In every year that is evenly divisible by 4.
- Unless the year is evenly divisible by 100, in which case it's only a leap year if the year is also evenly divisible by 400.

Some examples:

- 1997 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 4.
- 1900 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 400.
- 2000 was a leap year!



1. **A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4**:
   - This is the basic rule for determining leap years.
2. **However, if the year is also divisible by 100, it is not a leap year**:
   - This is an exception to the rule above.
3. **But if the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year**:
   - This is an exception to the exception.

Using the concepts above, we're going to develop a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year of not.

`functions.c`

```C
#include <stdbool.h>
bool leap_year(int year)
{
    if (year % 4 == 0)
    {
        if (year % 100 == 0)
        {
            if (year % 400 == 0)
            {
                return true; // leap year
            }
            else
            {
                return false; // not leap year
            }
        }
        else
        {
            return true; // leap year
        }
    }
    else
    {
        return false; // not leap year
    }
}
```

`practice.h`

```C
#include <stdbool.h>

bool leap_year(int year);
```

`main.c`

```C
int main()
{
    int year;
    printf("Enter a year: ");
    scanf("%d", &year);

    if (leap_year(year))
    {
        printf("%d is a leap year.\n", year);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("%d is not a leap year.\n", year);
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

`Code Execution`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter a year: 1997
1997 is not a leap year.
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice

2000 is a leap year.

### Sum of Squares or Square of sum?

Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is (1 + 2 + ... + 10)Â² = 55Â² = 3025.

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 1Â² + 2Â² + ... + 10Â² = 385.

Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

#### Traditional approach (for loop)

`functions.c`

```C
unsigned int sum_of_squares(unsigned int number){
    unsigned int result = 0;
    for(unsigned int i = 1; i <= number; i++){
        result += i * i;
    }
    return result;
}
// This algorithm iterates from 1 to number, summing the squares of each integer. The time complexity is O(n).


unsigned int square_of_sum(unsigned int number){
    unsigned int sum = 0;
    for(unsigned int i = 1; i <= number; i++){
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum * sum;
}
// THis algorithm iterates from 1 to number, summing the integers and then squaring the result. The time complexity is O(n).

unsigned int difference_of_squares(unsigned int number){
    return square_of_sum(number) - sum_of_squares(number);
}

// This algorithm simply calls the previous two functions and subtracts their results. The time complexity is O(n) due to the calls to square_of_sum and sum_of_square.
```

`practice.h`

```C
#ifndef PRACTICE_H
#define PRACTICE_H
// Functions.c

unsigned int sum_of_squares(unsigned int number);
unsigned int square_of_sum(unsigned int number);
unsigned int difference_of_squares(unsigned int number);
// Functions_2.c
#endif // PRACTICE_H
```

The `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif` directives are used to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file, which can cause errors and increase compilation time. This is known as an "include guard."

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **`#ifndef PRACTICE_H`**: This checks if `PRACTICE_H` has not been defined yet. If it hasn't, the code between `#ifndef` and `#endif` will be included.
2. **`#define PRACTICE_H`**: This defines `PRACTICE_H`, so the next time this header file is included, the `#ifndef PRACTICE_H` check will fail, preventing the contents of the header file from being included again.
3. **`#endif`**: This ends the conditional inclusion started by `#ifndef`.

This mechanism ensures that the contents of the header file are included only once, even if the header file is included multiple times in different source files or within the same source file.

Here is the `practice.h`file with the include guard:

```C
\#ifndef PRACTICE_H

\#define PRACTICE_H

void error(char *msg);

unsigned int sum_of_squares(unsigned int number);

unsigned int square_of_sum(unsigned int number);

unsigned int difference_of_squares(unsigned int number);

\#endif // PRACTICE_H
```

Without these include guards, if `practice.h` were included multiple times, the compiler would see multiple definitions of the same functions and variables, leading to errors.

`practice.c`(main file)

```C
int main(){
    int n;
    printf("Enter a term: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("Sum of squares: %u\n", sum_of_squares(n));
    printf("Square of sum: %u\n", difference_of_squares(n));
    printf("Diffs of squares: %u\n", difference_of_squares(n));
    return 0;
}
```

#### Best approach (O(1))

For large values of `n`, these algorithms can be optimized using mathematical formulas:

`functions.c`

```C
// S = n(n+1)(2n+1) / 6
unsigned int sum_of_squares(unsigned int number){
    return (number * (number + 1) * (2 * number + 1)) / 6;
}

// S = n(n+1) / 2
unsigned int square_of_sum(unsigned int number){
    unsigned int sum = (number * (number + 1)) / 2;
    return sum * sum;
}

unsigned int difference_of_squares(unsigned int number){
    return square_of_sum(number) - sum_of_squares(number);
}
```

##### 1. Sum of Squares

```C
unsigned int sum_of_squares(unsigned int number)
{
    return (number * (number + 1) * (2 * number + 1)) / 6;
}
```

**Formula**: S = n(n+1)(2n+1) / 6

**Explanation**:

- This formula comes from the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers.
- It can be derived using methods from calculus or algebraic manipulation.
- For example, for n=3:
  - S<sub>1</sub>= 1<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+3<sup>2</sup> = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14
  - Using the formula:
  - S<sub>1</sub> = 3 * 4 * 7 / 6 = 84 / 6 = 14

##### 2. Square of the Sum

```C
unsigned int square_of_sum(unsigned int number)
{
    unsigned int sum = (number * (number + 1)) / 2;
    return sum * sum;
}
```

**Formula**: S = n(n+1) / 2

**Explanation**:

- This formula calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and then squares the result.
- For example, for n=3:
  - S<sub>2</sub> = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
  - (S<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = 6<sup>2</sup> = 36
  - Using the formula:
  - (3 * 4 / 2)<sup>2</sup> = (6)<sup>2</sup> = 36

These formulas are efficient for large values of `n` as they avoid the need for iteration, reducing the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).

### Factorial 

The factorial of a non-negative integer ( n ) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to ( n ). 

By definition, the factorial of 0 is 1.

For example, if the number is 4, then the factorial of 4 will be calculated in a way:

4 = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

#### Iterative approach

`functions.c`

```C
int factorial_iterative(int n){
    int result = 1;
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}
```

`practice.c`(main file)

```C
int main()
{
    int terms;
    printf("Enter the number of terms: ");
    scanf("%d", &terms);
    printf("Factorial of %d (iterative) is %d\n", terms, factorial_iterative(terms));
    return 0;
}
```

`Code Execution`

```
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the number of terms: 4
Factorial of 4 (iterative) is 24

```



#### Recursive approach

`functions.c`

```C
int factorial_recursive(int n){
    if(n == 0 || n == 1){
        return 1;
    }else{
        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1);
    }
}
```

`practice.c`(main file)

```C
int main(){
    int terms;
    printf("Enter the number of terms: ");
    scanf("%d", &terms);
    printf("Factorial of %d (recursive) is %d\n", terms, factorial_recursive(terms));
}
```

### Number of grains of wheat on a chessboard

#### Instructions

Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that the number on each square doubles.

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up. Knowing that the king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains of wheat. One grain on the first square of a chess board, with **the number of grains doubling on each successive square**.

There are 64 squares on a chessboard (where square 1 has one grain, square 2 has two grains, and so on).

Write code that shows:

- how many grains were on a given square, and
- the total number of grains on the chessboard



#### Solutions

Let's consider the number of grains on each square according to the question:

Square 1: 1

Square 2: 2

Square 3: 4

Square 4: 8

Square 5: 16

...

Square 64: 9223372036854775807

#### Maths Formula Approach

`functions.c`

```C
uint64_t grains_on_square(int square)
{
    return (uint64_t)pow(2, square - 1);
}

uint64_t total_grains_on_chessboard()
{
    uint64_t total_grains = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 64; i++)
    {
        total_grains += grains_on_square(i);
    }
    return total_grains;
}
```

- `uint64_t` is a data type defined in the C standard library header `<stdint.h>`.
- It represents an unsigned 64-bit integer.
- This type is guaranteed to be 64 bits wide on all platforms, providing a consistent way to handle large integer values across different systems.
- **Unsigned**: It can only represent non-negative numbers (0 and positive integers)
- **64-bit**: It can represent values from 0 to 2<sup>64</sup>-1, which is 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.

`practice.c` (main file)

```C
int main()
{
    int square = 10; // Example square number
    printf("Grains on square %d: %lu\n", square, grains_on_square(square));
    printf("Total grains on chessboard: %lu\n", total_grains_on_chessboard());
    return 0;
}
```

`Code Execution`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Grains on square 10: 512
Total grains on chessboard: 18446744073709551615

```



#### Bitwise Operation Approach

`functions.c`

```C
uint64_t grains_on_square(int square)
{
    return (uint64_t)1 << (square - 1);
}

uint64_t total_grains_on_chessboard()
{
    // 3 different approach same results
    // ((uint64_t)1 << 64) - 1 would overflow, hence 2^64 - 1 is achieved by -1
    return ((uint64_t)1 << 63) - 1 + ((uint64_t)1 << 63);
    // Or 
    return ~(uint64_t)0;
    // Or
    uint64_t total_grains = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 64; i++) {
        total_grains += grains_on_square(i);
    }
    return total_grains;
}

```

- Uses `bitwise left shift` to calculate the number of grains on a specific square.
- It is efficient because left-shifting a 1 by `(square - 1)` bits directly computes 2<sup>(square - 1)</sup>.
- `total_grains_on_chessboard()`: Uses the property of bit-wise operations to calculate 2<sup>64</sup> - 1 directly, which is correct for calculating the sum of grains on all 64 squares.
- `((uint64_t)1 << 63) - 1` : In C, the behavior of shifting a value by an amount equal to or greater than the width of the type is undefined. For a 64-bit integer, shifting by 64 or more bits is not allowed and will result in undefined behavior. That's why we cannot use `((uint64_t)1 << 64)`.
  - `((uint64_t)1 << 63)` shifts the number 1 left by 63 bits, resulting in 2<sup>63</sup>.
  - Shifting by 64 bits or more is undefined because it exceeds the bit width of the type.

`practice.c` (main file)

```C
int main()
{
    int square = 10; // Example square number
    printf("Grains on square %d: %lu\n", square, grains_on_square(square));
    printf("Total grains on chessboard: %lu\n", total_grains_on_chessboard());
    return 0;
}
```

`Code Execution`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Grains on square 10: 512
Total grains on chessboard: 18446744073709551615

{
    float regular_pay = hours * rate;
    float overtime_hours = hours - 40;
    float overtime_pay = (40 * rate) + (1.5 * rate * (overtime_hours));

    if (hours > 40)
    {
        return overtime_pay;
    }
    else

### Filter Even numbers from a list

#### Instructions

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

#### Solution

- **`filter_even_numbers` function**:
  - Takes an input array `arr`, its size `size`, and a pointer to `result_size` to store the size of the result array.
  - Allocates memory for the result array using `malloc`.
  - Iterates through the input array and adds even numbers to the result array.
  - Updates the `result_size` with the number of even numbers found.
  - Optionally reallocates memory to fit the exact number of even numbers using `realloc`.
  - Returns the result array.
- **`main` function**:
  - Defines the original array and its size.
  - Calls `filter_even_numbers` to get the array of even numbers and its size.
  - Prints the result array.
  - Frees the allocated memory for the result array.

`functions.c`

```C

int *filter_even_numbers(int *arr, int size, int *result_size)
{
    // Allocate memory for the result array (maximum possible size is the same as input array)
    int *result = (int *)malloc(size * sizeof(int));

    if (result == NULL)
    {
        // Handle memory allocation failure
        *result_size = 0;
        return NULL;
    }

    // Initialize index for the result array
    int result_index = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
    {
        if (arr[i] % 2 == 0)
        {
            result[result_index++] = arr[i];
        }
    }

    // Update the result size with the number of even numbers found
    *result_size = result_index;

    // Reallocate memory to fit the exact number of even numbers
    result = (int *)realloc(result, result_index * sizeof(int));
    if (result == NULL & result_index > 0)
    {
        // Handle memory reallocation failure
        *result_size = 0;
        return NULL;
    }
    return result;
}
```

- **`malloc(size * sizeof(int))`**: Allocates a block of memory large enough to hold `size`integers. The `sizeof(int)` ensures that the correct amount of memory is allocated based on the size of the `int` type on the system.

- **`(int *)`**: Casts the `void *` returned by `malloc` to an `int *`, which is a pointer to an integer. This cast is necessary because `malloc` returns a generic pointer (`void *`), and you need to specify that this memory will be used to store integers.

- The `realloc` function in C is  used to resize a previously allocated block of memory. It takes two parameters:

  1. **Pointer to the previously allocated memory block**: This is the memory block that we want to resize.
  2. **New size in bytes**: This is the new size for the memory block.

- ```C
  void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
  ```

  - `ptr`: A pointer to the memory block previously allocated with `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`. If `ptr` is NULL, `realloc` behaves like `malloc`.
  - `size`: The new size for the memory block in bytes. If `size` is zero and `ptr` is not `NULL`, the memory block is freed.

`practice.c`(Main)

```C
int main()
{
    int original_arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 8, 10};
    int size = sizeof(original_arr) / sizeof(original_arr[0]);

    // variable to store the size of the result array
    int result_size;
    
    // call the function to filter even numbers from the array
    int *result = filter_even_numbers(original_arr, size, &result_size);

    // Check if the result array is not NULL (memory allocation was successful)
    if (result != NULL)
    {
        // Print the result array
        for (int i = 0; i < result_size; i++)
        {
            if(i == result_size - 1){
                // If it is the last element
                // put a new line character
                printf("%d\n", result[i]);
            }else{
                // if not, put a comma
                printf("%d, ", result[i]);
            }
        }
        printf("\n");

        // Free the allocated memory
        free(result);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Memory allocation failed.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Let's break down the connection between `result_size` and how it's used when passing it as an argument to the `filter_even_numbers` function in `main.c`.

#### `filter_even_numbers` Function

In the function `filter_even_numbers`, we have the following signature:

```C
int *filter_even_numbers(int *arr, int size, int *result_size);
```

- `arr`: Pointer to the input array.
- `size`: Size of the input array.
- `result_size`: Pointer to an integer where the size of the result array (number of even numbers) will be stored.

Within this function, `result_size` is used to store the number of even numbers found in the input array. This variable is modified inside the function to reflect the count of even numbers. Since it's a pointer, the changes made inside the function will be reflected in the variable passed from the caller (i.e., in `main.c`).

#### `main.c` Usage

In `main.c`, `result_size` is declared as an `int` variable:

```C
int result_size;
```

This variable is then passed to the `filter_even_numbers` function by its address:

```C
int *result = filter_even_numbers(original_arr, size, &result_size);
```

Here, `&result_size` passes the address of `result_size` to the function, allowing `filter_even_numbers` to modify its value.

#### Detailed Steps and Connection

1. **Variable Declaration in `main.c`**:

   ```C
   int result_size;
   ```

   - `result_size` is declared to store the size of the array of even numbers.

2. **Passing `result_size` to `filter_even_numbers`**:

   ```C
   int *result = filter_even_numbers(original_arr, size, &result_size);
   ```

   - The address of `result_size` is passed to `filter_even_numbers`.

3. **Inside `filter_even_numbers`**:

   ```C
   int *filter_even_numbers(int *arr, int size, int *result_size)
   {
       // Various operations...
       
       // Update the result size with the number of even numbers found
       *result_size = result_index;
   
       // Reallocate memory to fit the exact number of even numbers
       result = (int *)realloc(result, result_index * sizeof(int));
   
       // Various operations...
   }
   ```

   - The function updates `*result_size` to the number of even numbers found (`result_index`).
   - This change is made directly to the memory location of `result_size` in `main.c` because `result_size` is passed by reference.

4. **Back in `main.c`**:

   ```C
   if (result != NULL)
   {
       // Print the result array
       for (int i = 0; i < result_size; i++)
       {
           printf("%d ", result[i]);
       }
       printf("\n");
   
       // Free the allocated memory
       free(result);
   }
   ```

   - After the function call, `result_size` in `main.c` contains the number of even numbers found.
   - This value is used in the loop to print the elements of the result array.

#### Summary

- `result_size` is declared in `main.c` to store the size of the filtered array.
- The address of `result_size` is passed to `filter_even_numbers`.
- `filter_even_numbers` updates the value at the address of `result_size` with the count of even numbers.
- This updated value is then used in `main.c` to iterate over and print the result array.

By passing the address of `result_size`, changes made within `filter_even_numbers` are reflected in the original variable in `main.c`, enabling the main function to know how many even numbers were found and stored in the result array.

### Collatz Conjecture

#### Instructions

The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:

Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will always reach 1 eventually.

Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.

#### Examples

Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:

1. 12
2. 6
3. 3
4. 10
5. 5
6. 16
7. 8
8. 4
9. 2
10. 1

Resulting in 9 steps. So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.



`functions.c`

```C
void error(char *msg){
    fprintf(stderr, "%s", msg);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

int steps(int start){
    if(start <= 0){
        error("value cannot be less than or equal to 0.\n");
    }
    int count = 0;
    while(start != 1){
        // Print the current value
        printf("%d\n", start);
        if(start % 2 == 0){
            start /= 2;
            count++;
        }else{
            start = 3 * start + 1;
            count++;
        }
    }
    // print the final value
    printf("%d\n", start);
    return count;
}
```

`practice.c` (main)

```C
int main(){
    int n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("According to Collatz Conjecture, \n");
    printf("The number of steps for %d to reach 1 is %d\n", n, steps(n));
    return 0;
}
```

`Output`

```sh

### Queen Attack Program

#### Instructions
Given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.

In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row, column, or diagonal.

A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.

So if you are told the white queen is at c5 (zero-indexed at column 2, row 3) and the black queen at f2 (zero-indexed at column 5, row 6), then you know that the set-up is like so:

 ```
   a b c d e f g h
 8 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 8
 7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 7
 6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 6
 5 _ _ W _ _ _ _ _ 5
 4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 4
 3 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 3
 2 _ _ _ _ _ B _ _ 2
 1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1
   a b c d e f g h
 ```

You are also able to answer whether the queens can attack each other. In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces share a diagonal.

#### Solution

To determine if two queens can attack each other on a chessboard, we need to check if they share the same row, column, or diagonal.

##### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Same Row:** The queens are on the same row if their row indices are equal.
2. **Same Column:** The queens are on the same column if their column indices are equal.
3. **Same Diagonal:** The queens are on the same diagonal if the absolute difference between their row indices equals the absolute difference between their column indices.

##### Detailed Breakdown on Diagonals

- In chess, a queen can attack another piece if they are on the same diagonal. 
- To determine if two queens are on the same diagonal, we need to check if the absolute difference between their row indices is equal to the absolute difference between their column indices.

###### Explanation:
**Diagonal Movement:** A queen moves diagonally by changing both its row and column by the same amount. For example, moving from (row 3, column 2) to (row 6, column 5) involves changing the row by 3 and the column by 3.
**Absolute Difference:** The absolute difference ensures that we are considering the magnitude of the change, regardless of direction (positive or negative).

###### Mathematical Justification:

If two positions (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) are on the same diagonal, then the difference in rows `|r1 - r2|` must be equal to the difference in columns `|c1 - c2|`.
###### Example:

Consider two queens at positions `(3, 2)`and `(6, 5)`:

- Row difference: `|3 - 6| = 3`
- Column difference: `|2 - 5| = 3`
- Since both differences are equal, the queens are on the same diagonal.

##### Code Implementation

`practice.h`

```C
typedef enum{
    CAN_NOT_ATTACK,
    CAN_ATTACK,
    INVALID_POSITION
} attack_status_t;

typedef struct{
    uint8_t row;
    uint8_t column;
}position_t;

attack_status_t can_attack(position_t queen_1, position_t queen_2);
```



`functions.c`

```C
attack_status_t can_attack(position_t queen_1, position_t queen_2){
    // Invalid position check: If any row or column is out of bounds (>= 8)
    if (queen_1.row >= 8 || queen_1.column >= 8 || queen_2.row >= 8 || queen_2.column >= 8)
    {
        return INVALID_POSITION;
    }

    // Same position check
    if (queen_1.row == queen_2.row && queen_1.column == queen_2.column)
    {
        return INVALID_POSITION;
    }

    // Check if they can attack each other:
    // 1. Same row
    if (queen_1.row == queen_2.row)
    {
        return CAN_ATTACK;
    }

    // 2. Same column
    if (queen_1.column == queen_2.column)
    {
        return CAN_ATTACK;
    }

    // 3. Same diagonal
    if (abs(queen_1.row - queen_2.row) == abs(queen_1.column - queen_2.column))
    {
        return CAN_ATTACK;
    }

    // If none of the conditions are met, they cannot attack each other
    return CAN_NOT_ATTACK;
}
```

`practice.c (Main file)`

```C
int main()
{
    position_t white_queen = {3, 2}; // c5
    position_t black_queen = {6, 5}; // f2

    attack_status_t result = can_attack(white_queen, black_queen);

    if (result == CAN_ATTACK)
    {
        printf("The queens can attack each other.\n");
    }
    else if (result == CAN_NOT_ATTACK)
    {
        printf("The queens cannot attack each other.\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Invalid position.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

```



`practice.c`(Main)

    // Get the position of the White Queen
    printf("Enter the position of the White Queen (e.g., c5): ");
    scanf(" %c%d", &column, &row);
    white_queen.column = column - 'a';
    white_queen.row = row - 1;

    // Get the position of the Black Queen
    printf("Enter the position of the Black Queen (e.g., f2): ");
    scanf(" %c%d", &column, &row);
    black_queen.column = column - 'a';
    black_queen.row = row - 1;

    // Display the board with the queens
    print_board(white_queen, black_queen);

    // Determine if the queens can attack each other
    attack_status_t result = can_attack(white_queen, black_queen);

    if (result == CAN_ATTACK)
    {
        printf("The queens can attack each other.\n");
    }
    else if (result == CAN_NOT_ATTACK)
    {
        printf("The queens cannot attack each other.\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Invalid position.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

```

**Explanation:**

**Conversion Logic**

- Why `column - 'a'` and `row - 1`]?

- **`column - 'a'`**: This converts the column character (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c', etc.) to a zero-based index. For example, 'a' becomes 0, 'b' becomes 1, and so on. This is necessary because array indices in C are zero-based.
- **`row - 1`**: This converts the row number (which is 1-based as entered by the user) to a zero-based index. For example, row 1 becomes 0, row 2 becomes 1, and so on. This is also necessary for zero-based array indexing.

- The column is converted using `column - 'a'`, which should correctly map 'a' to 0, 'b' to 1, ..., 'h' to 7.
- The row is converted using `row - 1`, which should correctly map 1 to 0, 2 to 1, ..., 8 to 7.

1. **Variable Declarations**: Declares variables for the positions of the white and black queens (`white_queen`, `black_queen`), and temporary variables for reading input (`column`, `row`).
2. **Get White Queen Position**:
   - Prompts the user to enter the position of the white queen.
   - Reads the input using `scanf` and converts the column from a character to an integer index (`column - 'a'`) and the row to a zero-based index (`row - 1`).
3. **Get Black Queen Position**:
   - Prompts the user to enter the position of the black queen.
   - Reads the input and converts it similarly to the white queen's position.
4. **Print the Board**: Calls `print_board` to display the current positions of the queens on the board.
5. **Check Attack Possibility**:
   - Calls `can_attack` to determine if the queens can attack each other.
   - Prints the result based on the return value of `can_attack`:
     - `CAN_ATTACK`: Prints that the queens can attack each other.
     - `CAN_NOT_ATTACK`: Prints that the queens cannot attack each other.
     - `INVALID_POSITION`: Prints that the position is invalid.
6. **Return**: Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

`Output`

```sh

### Darts

#### Instructions
Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.

Darts is a game where players throw darts at a target.

In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:

- If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).

- If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.

- If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.

- If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.


The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1. Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are concentric defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its Cartesian coordinates x and y, where x and y are real), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.



#### Solution

`practice.h`

```C
int dart_score(double x, double y);
```

`functions.c`

```C
int dart_score(double x, double y)
{
    // Calculate the distance from the center of the dartboard (0, 0)
    double distance = sqrt(pow(x, 2) + pow(y, 2));

    // Determine the score based on the distance
    if (distance > 10.0)
    {
        return 0; // Outside the target
    }
    else if (distance > 5.0)
    {
        return 1; // Outer circle
    }
    else if (distance > 1.0)
    {
        return 5; // Middle circle
    }
    else
    {
        return 10; // Inner circle
    }
}
```

`practice.c` (main)

```C
int main()
{
    double x;
    double y;
    printf("Enter the x coordinate: ");
    scanf("%lf", &x);
    printf("Enter the y coordinate: ");
    scanf("%lf", &y);

    double score = dart_score(x, y);
    printf("Your score is %.1lf\n", score);
    return 0;
}

```

`Output`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the x coordinate: 2
Enter the y coordinate: 2
Your score is 5.0
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the x coordinate: 5
Enter the y coordinate: 6
Your score is 1.0
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the x coordinate: 0
Enter the y coordinate: 1
Your score is 10.0
```

**Explanation**

- The function `dart_score` takes two `double` parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the coordinates of where the dart lands on the board.
- It first calculates the distance from the origin `(0, 0)` using the Pythagorean theorem: `distance = sqrt(x * x + y * y)`.
- The function then checks the distance to determine which circle the dart landed in and returns the corresponding score:
  - If the distance is greater than 10, the dart is outside the target, so the function returns `0`.
  - If the distance is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10, the dart is in the outer circle, and the function returns `1`.
  - If the distance is greater than 1 but less than or equal to 5, the dart is in the middle circle, and the function returns `5`.
  - If the distance is less than or equal to 1, the dart is in the inner circle, and the function returns `10`.

uint8_t dart_score(coordinate_t position);
```

`functions.c`

```C
uint8_t dart_score(coordinate_t position)
{
    // Calculate the distance from the target (0, 0)
    float distance = hypot(position.x, position.y);

    if (distance <= 1.0F)
    {
        return 10; // Inner circle
    }
    else if (distance <= 5.0F)
    {
        return 5; // Middle circle
    }
    else if (distance <= 10.0F)
    {
        return 1; // Outer circle
    }
    else
    {
        return 0; // Outside the target
    }
}
```

    printf("Enter the x coordinate: ");
    scanf("%f", &x);
    printf("Enter the y coordinate: ");
    scanf("%f", &y);

    coordinate_t position = {x, y};
    uint8_t score = dart_score(position);
    printf("Your score is %u\n", score);
    return 0;
}

```

`Output`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the x coordinate: 0
Enter the y coordinate: 1
Your score is 10
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the x coordinate: 3
Enter the y coordinate: 4
Your score is 5
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the x coordinate: 6
Enter the y coordinate: 7
Your score is 1
```

In C, the `F` suffix is used to indicate that a literal is of type `float`. Without the `F` suffix, the literal is treated as a `double` by default. Using `float` literals can be important for performance and precision reasons, especially when working with functions or variables that are explicitly of type `float`.

```C
float distance = 1.0F; // 'distance' is a float
double distance = 1.0; // 'distance' is a double
```

In our code, if we are calculating the distance using `float` variables, we should use `float` literals to avoid unnecessary type conversions and to maintain precision.



#### Additional Things to Note

- Using `uint8_t` for the return type of the `dart_score`function is appropriate if the score values are guaranteed to be small and non-negative, as it saves memory and clearly indicates the range of possible values. 

- However, if you anticipate that the score might need to handle larger values or if there's a possibility of negative values in the future, using `int` might be more flexible.

- In this specific case, since the scores are small and non-negative (0, 1, 5, 10), `uint8_t` is a good choice. 

- It makes the code more efficient in terms of memory usage and clearly communicates that the values are within the range of 0 to 255.

### Resistor Color Duo

#### Instructions
If you want to build something using a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably use resistors. For this exercise, you need to know two things about them:

Each resistor has a resistance value.
Resistors are small - so small in fact that if you printed the resistance value on them, it would be hard to read.
To get around this problem, manufacturers print color-coded bands onto the resistors to denote their resistance values. Each band has a position and a numeric value.

The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number. For example, if they printed a brown band (value 1) followed by a green band (value 5), it would translate to the number 15.

In this exercise you are going to create a helpful program so that you don't have to remember the values of the bands. The program will take color names as input and output a two digit number, even if the input is more than two colors!

The band colors are encoded as follows:

black: 0
brown: 1
red: 2
orange: 3
yellow: 4
green: 5
blue: 6
violet: 7
grey: 8
white: 9
From the example above: brown-green should return 15, and brown-green-violet should return 15 too, ignoring the third color.



#### First Solution

`practice.h`

```C
extern const char *color_codes[];

int get_color_value(char *color);
```

`functions.c`

```C
const char *color_codes[] = {"black", "brown", "red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "violet", "grey", "white"};

int get_color_value(char *color)
{
    // Iterate through the color_codes array to find the color
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        if (strcasecmp(color, color_codes[i]) == 0)
        {
            return i;
        }
    }
    // Return -1 if the color is not found
    return -1;
}
```

`practice.c`

```C
int main()
{
    // Define variables
    char input[30];
    char color1[10], color2[10];

    // Get the input as a single string
    printf("Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): ");
    scanf("%s", input);

    // Split the input by the hyphen
    sscanf(input, "%[^-]-%[^-]", color1, color2);

    // Convert the first two colors to their respective values
    int value1 = get_color_value(color1);
    int value2 = get_color_value(color2);

    // Check if the input colors are valid
    if (value1 == -1 || value2 == -1)
    {
        printf("Invalid color entered.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Calculate the two-digit number;
    int result = value1 * 10 + value2;

    // Print the result
    printf("The resistor value is: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

```

`Output`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): brown-green
The resistor value is: 15

chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): brown-green-violet
The resistor value is: 15

chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): Brown-Green
The resistor value is: 15
```

#### Additional Things to Note

`sscanf(input, "%[^-]-%[^-]", color1, color2);` which captures the first two color names separated by hyphens and ignores any additional colors. This ensures that only the first two colors are processed, and any extra colors are ignored.

-  The format string `"%[^-]-%[^-]"` used in `sscanf` is a way to parse a string by splitting it based on a delimiter, in this case, the hyphen (`-`).

##### Explanation of `"%[^-]-%[^-]"`

1. **`%[^-]`**:
   - The `%` character indicates the start of a format specifier.
   - The `[` character introduces a scanset, which is a set of characters to be matched.
   - The `^` character inside the scanset negates the set, meaning it will match any character except those in the set.
   - The `-` character inside the scanset specifies that the hyphen character should not be matched.
   - Therefore, `%[^-]` matches any sequence of characters up to, but not including, the first hyphen.
2. **`-`**:
   - This matches the literal hyphen character in the input string.
3. **`%[^-]`**:
   - This is another scanset that matches any sequence of characters up to, but not including, the next hyphen.

##### Putting It All Together

- `"%[^-]-%[^-]` tells `sscanf` to:
  1. Read characters into the first variable (`color1`) until a hyphen is encountered.
  2. Skip the hyphen.
  3. Read characters into the second variable (`color2`) until another hyphen is encountered or the end of the string is reached.

##### Example

Given the input string `"brown-green-violet"`:

- `%[^-]` will match `"brown"` and store it in `color1`.
- The hyphen `-` will be skipped.
- `%[^-]` will match `"green"` and store it in `color2`.

The third color `"violet"` will be ignored because the format string only specifies two scansets.



**More about `delimiter` can be found  in `essentials.md`.**



##### Explanation of `sscanf`

- In C, the `sscanf` function is used to read formatted input from a string. 
- It is similar to `scanf`, but instead of reading from standard input, it reads from a provided string.

`Syntax`

```C
int sscanf(const char *str, const char *format, ...);
```

`Parameters`

- `str`: The input string from which to read the data.
- `format`: The format string that specifies how to interpret the input.
- `...`: The additional arguments that point to the variables where the parsed values will be stored.

`Return Value`

- The function returns the number of input items successfully matched and assigned. 
- If the input does not match the format, it returns `EOF`.

`Example`

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char input[] = "brown green";
    char color1[10], color2[10];

    // Use sscanf to parse the input string
    int result = sscanf(input, "%s %s", color1, color2);

    if (result == 2) {
        printf("Color 1: %s\n", color1);
        printf("Color 2: %s\n", color2);
    } else {
        printf("Failed to parse input\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

`Explanation`

- The `input` string contains the colors "brown" and "green".
- The `sscanf` function is used to parse these colors into the `color1`and `color2` variables.
- The format string `"%s %s"` specifies that two strings separated by a space should be read.
- The `result` variable will contain the number of successfully parsed items, which should be 2 in this case.

#### Second Solution (Better Approach)

`practice.h`

```C
#define ERROR_VALUE ((resistor_band_t) - 1)
typedef enum{
    BLACK = 0,
    BROWN,
    RED,
    ORANGE,
    YELLOW,
    GREEN,
    BLUE,
    VIOLET,
    GREY,
    WHITE
} resistor_band_t;

// Struct to map color names to resistor_band_t values
typedef struct{
    const char *name;
    resistor_band_t value;
}color_map_t;

uint16_t color_code(const resistor_band_t *bands);

resistor_band_t lookup_color_value(const char *color);
```

`functions.c`

```C
color_map_t color_map[] = {
    {"black", BLACK},
    {"brown", BROWN},
    {"red", RED},
    {"orange", ORANGE},
    {"yellow", YELLOW},
    {"green", GREEN},
    {"blue", BLUE},
    {"violet", VIOLET},
    {"grey", GREY},
    {"white", WHITE},
    {NULL, ERROR_VALUE}
};

// Function to print the duo color value
uint16_t color_code(const resistor_band_t *bands){
    return bands[0] * 10 + bands[1];
}

resistor_band_t lookup_color_value(const char *color){
    // Iterate till the name of the struct is equal to NULL (the last value)
    for(int i = 0; color_map[i].name != NULL; i++){
        if(strcasecmp(color, color_map[i].name) == 0){
            return color_map[i].value;
        }
    }
    return ERROR_VALUE;
}
```

`practice.c`

```C
int main(){
    char input[30];
    char color1[10], color2[10];
    resistor_band_t bands[2];
    
    printf("Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): ");
    scanf("%s", input);
    
    // Read up to two color codes separated by a hyphen
    sscanf(input, "%[^-]-%[^-]", color1, color2);
    
    // Look up resistor_band_t values for the colors
    bands[0] = lookup_color_values(color1);
    bands[1] = lookup_color_values(color2);
    
    if(bands[0] == ERROR_VALUE || bands[1] == ERROR_VALUE){
        fprintf(stderr, "Invalid color name.\n");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    
    // Calculate the resistor value
    uint16_t resistor_value = color_code(bands);
    
    printf("The resistor value is %u\n", resistor_value);
    return 0;
}
```

`Output`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): brown-green
The resistor value is 15
    
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): brown-green-violet
The resistor value is 15
    
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): black-white
The resistor value is 9
    
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): Brown-Green
The resistor value is 15
    
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): Brown
Invalid color name.
```

#### Explanation

- The `color_map_t` struct maps color names to their corresponding `resistor_band_t`values.
- The `color_map` array holds the mappings, ending with a sentinel value.
- The `lookup_color_value` function searches the `color_map` array for the given color name and returns the corresponding `resistor_band_t` value.
- The `main` function prompts the user for input, parses the first two colors, looks up their `resistor_band_t` values using `lookup_color_value`, and then calls `color_code` to get the color code.
- The result is printed to the console.

### Hamming Program

#### Instructions

Calculate the Hamming Distance between two DNA strands.

Your body is made up of cells that contain DNA. Those cells regularly wear out and need replacing, which they achieve by dividing into daughter cells. In fact, the average human body experiences about 10 quadrillion cell divisions in a lifetime!

When cells divide, their DNA replicates too. Sometimes during this process mistakes happen and single pieces of DNA get encoded with the incorrect information. If we compare two strands of DNA and count the differences between them we can see how many mistakes occurred. This is known as the "Hamming Distance".

We read DNA using the letters C,A,G and T. Two strands might look like this:

```
GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^
```

They have 7 differences, and therefore the Hamming Distance is 7.

The Hamming Distance is useful for lots of things in science, not just biology, so it's a nice phrase to be familiar with :)

#### Implementation notes

The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length, so an attempt to calculate it between sequences of different lengths should not work.



#### Solution

`practice.h`

```C
int compute(const char *lhs, const char *rhs);
```

`functions.c`

```C
int compute(const char *lhs, const char *rhs)
{
    int hamming_distance = 0;

    // Check if the lengths are equal
    if (strlen(lhs) != strlen(rhs))
    {
        return -1; //
    }

    // Calculate the Hamming distance
    for (int i = 0; lhs[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        if (lhs[i] != rhs[i])
        {
            hamming_distance++;
        }
    }

    return hamming_distance;
}
```

`practice.c`

```C
int main()
{
    const char *strand1 = "GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT";
    const char *strand2 = "CATCGTAATGACGGCCT";

    int distance = compute(strand1, strand2);

    if (distance == -1)
    {
        printf("Error: DNA strands must be of equal length.\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Hamming Distance: %d\n", distance);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

`Output`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Hamming Distance: 7

```

## Space Age

### Instructions

Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:

- Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
- Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
- Earth: orbital period 1.0 Earth years, 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
- Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
- Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
- Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
- Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
- Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say that they're 31.69 Earth-years old.

If you're wondering why Pluto didn't make the cut, go watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_2gbGXzFbs).

Note: The actual length of one complete orbit of the Earth around the sun is closer to 365.256 days (1 sidereal year). The Gregorian calendar has, on average, 365.2425 days. While not entirely accurate, 365.25 is the value used in this exercise. See [Year on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#Summary) for more ways to measure a year.
