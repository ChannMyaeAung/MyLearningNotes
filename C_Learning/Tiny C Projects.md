# Tiny C Projects

- I have decided to put all the contents and projects from the book called "Tiny C Projects" written by Dan Gookin to later review and revise what I have learnt from the book as well as related information or improvements from external sources.
- We are going to be building upon the program's idea, often presenting a simple version and then expanding the program to offer more features.
- Sometimes other programs are introduced along the way, each of which follows the main theme or otherwise assists the primary program in its goal.

## 1. Daily greetings

### Instructions

- Write a simple greetings program.
- Modify your grettings program to add the time of day.
- Update the timestamp with the current moon phase.
- Enhance your grettings message with a `bon mot`.

### Solution 

#### Things to Keep in mind

- The C library is rife with time functions, all defined in the `time.h` header file.
- The `time_t` data type is also defined in the header.
- This positive integer value (long data type, `printf()` placeholder `%ld`) stores the Unix epoch, the number of seconds ticking away since midnight January 1, 1970.
- The Unix epoch is a great value to use in our grettings program.
- However, the `time_t` value must be manipulated into something a bit more useful.
- Be aware that many time functions, such as `time()` and `ctime()` used in the code for our program solution require the address of the `time_t` variable. 
- Yup, they are pointers.

```C
int main(){
    time_t now;
    
    // The time() function requires the time_t variable's address, prefixed here with the & address-of operator.
    time(&now);
    printf("The computer think it's %ld\n", now);
    
    // The ctime() function requires a pointer argument and returns a string appended with a newline.
    printf("%s", ctime(&now));
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
The computer thinks it's 1726504705
Tue Sep 17 00:38:25 2024
```

- The output shows the number of seconds tick-tocking since 1970.
- This same value is swallowed by the `ctime()` function to output a formatted time string.
- This result may be acceptable, but time data can be customized further.
- The key to unlocking specific time details is found in the `localtime()` function, as the following code here demonstrates.

```C
int main()
{
    time_t now;
    
    // because localtime() returns a pointer, it's best to declare the structure as a pointer
    struct tm *clock;
    time(&now);

    clock = localtime(&now);
    puts("Time details: ");
    printf("Day of the year: %d\n", clock->tm_year);
    
    // The first day of the week is 0 for Sunday
    printf("Day of the week: %d\n", clock->tm_wday);
    
    // We must add 1900 to the tm_year member to get the current year
    printf("Year %d\n", clock->tm_year + 1900);
    
    // The tm_mon member ranges from 0 to 11
    printf("Month: %d\n", clock->tm_mon + 1);
    printf("Day of the month: %d\n", clock->tm_mday);
    printf("Hour: %d\n", clock->tm_hour);
    printf("Minutes: %d\n", clock->tm_min);
    printf("Seconds: %d\n", clock->tm_sec);
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Time details: 
Day of the year: 124
Day of the week: 2
Year 2024
Month: 9
Day of the month: 17
Hour: 0
Minutes: 46
Seconds: 7
```

- Based on the output, we can conclude that my machine at the time of practicing this is:
  - It's 124 day of the year 2024. 
  - It's Tuesday (as Day of the week is 2)
  - The month is September (Month: 9)
  - Hour, Minutes, Seconds (12:46:07 AM)
  - **Conclusion:** It is written at 12 AM midnight, on September 17th 2024, Tuesday.



**The code fetches the current hour of the day and outputs an appropriate time-of-day greeting**

```C
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    time_t now;
    struct tm *clock;
    int hour;
    
    time(&now);
    clock = localtime(&now);
    
    // This statement is a convenience to avoid using clock->tm_hour over and over
    hour = clock->tm_hour;
    
    printf("Good ");
    if(hour < 12){
        printf("morning");
    }else if(hour > 12){
        printf("afternoon");
    }else{
        printf("evening");
    }
    
    if(argc > 1){
        printf(", %s", argv[1]);
    }
    
    putchar('\n');
    
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Good morning
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final Chan
Good morning, Chan
```



#### Adding specific time info

- A simple way to output a detailed time string is to output a greeting followed by a time string generated by the `ctime()` function.

```C
printf("Good day, %s\n", argv[1]);
printf("It's %s", ctime(&now));
```

- Still the program is lazy. Better to incorporate the `strftime()` function, which formats a timestamp string according to our specifications.
- The `strftime()` function works like `printf()`, with a special string that formats time information.
- The function's output is saved in a buffer, which our code can use later.

```C
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    time_t now;
    struct tm *clock;
    
    // Storage for the string filled by the strftime() function
    char time_string[64];
    
    time(&now);
    
    // We must fill a localtime() tm structure to make the strftime() function work
    clock = localtime(&now);
    
    strftime(time_string, 64, "Today is %A, %B %d, %Y%nIt is %r%n", clock);
    
    printf("Greetings");
    if(argc > 1){
        printf(", %s", argv[1]);
    }
    
    printf("!\n%s", time_string);
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final Chan
Greetings, Chan!
Today is Tuesday, September 17, 2024
It is 02:15:40 AM
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Greetings!
Today is Tuesday, September 17, 2024
It is 02:15:44 AM
```

- `man strftime` in terminal to discover all the fun placeholders and what they do.
- Like the `printf()` function, the placeholders are prefixed by a % character.
- Any other text in the formatting string is output as is.
- `%A` - Full name for the current day of the week.
- `%B` - Full name for the current month.
- `%d` - Day of the month, 01 to 31.
- `%Y` - 4-digit year
- `%n` - Newline
- `%r` - Time with AM/PM
- The output reflects the time string generated and stored in the `time_string[]` buffer.
- The time string appears after the general greeting.
