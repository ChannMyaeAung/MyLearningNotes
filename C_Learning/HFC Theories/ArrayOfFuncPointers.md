#### Create an array of function pointers

The trick is to create an array of function pointers that match the different response types.

```C
void (*replies[])(response) = {dump, second_chance, marriage};

// void - each function in the array will be a void function
// (*replies[]) - The variable will be called "replies" and it's not just a function pointer; it's a whole array of them.
// (response) - Just one parameter with type "response".

```

| Return type | (*Pointer variable) | (Param types) |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| void        | (*replies[])        | (response)    |

#### But how does an array help?

It contains a set of function names that are in exactly the same order as the types in the `enum`:

```C
enum response_type{
    DUMP,
    SECOND_CHANCE,
    MARRIAGE
};
```

This is really important because when C creates an `enum`, it gives each of the symbols a number starting at 0.

- So `DUMP == 0`, `SECOND_CHANCE == 1`, and `MARRIAGE == 2`. And that's really neat because it means you can get a pointer to one of your sets of functions using a `response_type`.

```C
replies[SECOND_CHANCE] = second_chance;

// replies - this is your "replies" array of functions
// SECOND_CHANCE - has the  value 1.
// second_chance - it's equal to the name of the second_chance function.

// void (*replies[])(response) = {dump, second_chance, marriage};
// replies[0] will run the funciton "dump"
// replies[1] will run the function "second_chance"
// replies[2] will run the function "marriage"

// replies[0] == DUMP
// replies[1] == SECOND_CHANCE
// replies[2] == MARRIAGE .Since enum gives each of the symbols a number starting at 0 as mentioned above.
```
