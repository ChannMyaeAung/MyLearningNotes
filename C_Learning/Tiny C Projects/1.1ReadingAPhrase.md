- In C, `feof` is a function that checks whether the end-of-file indicator associated with a given file stream is set. It is defined in the `<stdio.h>` header file.
- The `feof` function returns a non-zero value (true) if the end-of-file indicator is set for the specified stream.
- It returns zero (false) otherwise.
- The `feof` function is typically used in a loop to determine when the end of a file has been reached while reading from the file. 
- However, it is important to note that `feof` only returns true after an attempt to read past the end of the file has been made. Therefore, it is often used in conjunction with other file reading functions like `fgets`, `fscanf`, or `fread`.

```C
int main()
{
    const char filename[] = "pithy.txt";
    FILE *fp;

    // The buffer is used to read text from the file; the size is a guess, set as defined constant BSIZE (line 4).
    char buffer[BSIZE];
    char *r, *entry;
    int items = 0;

    fp = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (fp == NULL)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error opening file %s\n", filename);
        exit(1);
    }

    // Loop as long as the file isn't empty
    while (!feof(fp))
    {
        // The variable r ensures that fgets() doesn't mess up and read beyond the end of the file; if so, the loop stops
        r = fgets(buffer, BSIZE, fp);

        if (r == NULL)
        {
            break;
        }

        // Enough storage for the string, plus one for the null character
        entry = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * strlen(buffer) + 1);

        if (entry == NULL)
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "Unable to allocate memory\n");
            exit(1);
        }

        strcpy(entry, buffer);
        printf("%d: %s\n", items, entry);
        items++;
        // Outputs all the lines in the file
    }

    fclose(fp);
    return 0;
}

- As the program sits now, it allocates a series of buffers to store the strings read.
- Yet the addresses for these buffers are lost in memory.
- To resolve this issue, a pointer-pointer is required.
- The pointer-pointer, or address of a pointer, keeps track of all the string's memory locations.

```C
#define BSIZE 256

int main(){
    const char filename[] = "pithy.txt";
    FILE *fp;
    
    // The buffer is used to read text from the file; the size is a guess, set as defined constant BSIZE (line 4).
    char buffer[BSIZE];
    char *r, *entry;
    int items = 0;
    int saying;
    char **list_base;
    
    fp = fopen(filename, "r");
    if(fp == NULL){
        fprintf(stderr, "Error opening file %s\n", filename);
        exit(1);
    }
    
    list_base = (char **)malloc(sizeof(char *) * 100);
    
    if(list_base == NULL){
        fprintf(stderr, "Unable to allocate memory\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    
    // Loop as long as the file isn't empty
    while(!feof(fp)){
        // The variable r ensures that fgets() doesn't mess up and read beyong the end of the file; if so, the loop stops
        r = fgets(buffer, BSIZE, fp);
        
        if(r == NULL){
            break;
        }
        
        // Enough storage for the string, plus one for the null character
        entry = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * strlen(buffer) + 1);
        
        if(entry == NULL){
            fprintf(stderr, "Unable to allocate memory\n");
            exit(1);
        }
        
        // Copy the string from the buffer into the newly allocated memory pointed to by entry
        strcpy(entry, buffer);
        
        // Stores the pointer entry in the array list_base at the position indicated by items.
        // same as list_base[items] = entry;
        *(list_base + items) = entry;
        item++;
        
        // Every time items is exactly divisible by 100
        // means the file read contains more than 100 lines of text, reallocate memory to prevent memory overflow
        if(items % 100 == 0){
            // Existing storage is increased by 100 pointer-size chunks.
            lisst_base = (char **)realloc(list_base, sizeof(char *) * (items + 100));
            if(list_base == NULL){
                fprintf(stderr, "Unable to reallocate memory\n");
                exit(1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    fclose(fp);
    
    // Output a random line of text
    srand((unsigned)time(NULL));
    saying = rand() % (items - 1);
    printf("%s", *(list_base + saying));
}
```

1. **Line 67: `*(list_base + items) = entry;`**
   - **Purpose**: This line stores the pointer `entry` in the array `list_base` at the position indicated by `items`.
   - **Details:**
     - `list_base` is a pointer to an array of character pointers (`char **`), which is used to store the lines read from the file.
     - `items` is an integer that keeps track of the number of lines read so far.
     - `*(list_base + items)` is equivalent to `list_base[items]`, which accesses the `items`-th element of the array.
     - This line effectively stores the pointer to the copied string in the `items`-th position of `list_base`.
2. **Line 68: `items++;`**
   - **Purpose**: This line increments the `items` counter by 1.
   - **Details:**
     - After storing the pointer to the copied string in `list_base`, the `items` counter is incremented to reflect that another line has been read and stored.
     - This ensures that the next line read from the file will be stored in the next position in the `list_base` array.

Summary

- **Line 66** copies the content of the `buffer` into the newly allocated memory pointed to by `entry`.
- **Line 67** stores the pointer to the copied string in the `list_base` array at the position indicated by `items`.
- **Line 68** increments the `items` counter to keep track of the number of lines read and stored.

#### Purpose of `strcpy(entry, buffer)`

- **Function**: Copies the string from `buffer` to the memory location pointed to by `entry`.
- **Reason**: `entry` is a newly allocated memory block that will hold the string read from the file.

#### Purpose of `*(list_base + items) = entry`

- **Function**: Stores the pointer `entry` in the array `list_base` at the position indicated by `items`.
- **Reason**: `list_base` is an array of pointers (`char **`) that keeps track of all the lines read from the file. By storing `entry` in `list_base`, you are effectively saving the location of the copied string so that you can access it later.

#### Why Both are Needed

1. **Copying the String**: `strcpy(entry, buffer)` ensures that the content of the buffer is copied to a new memory location (`entry`). This is necessary because `buffer` will be reused in the next iteration of the loop to read the next line from the file.
2. **Storing the Pointer**: `*(list_base + items) = entry` (or equivalently `list_base[items] = entry`) stores the pointer to the newly copied string in the `list_base` array. This allows you to keep track of all the lines read from the file. Without this step, you would lose the reference to the copied string, and it would be impossible to access it later.

### Important Note regarding the pithy program

- The program doesn't release any memory directly. 
- Normally, the end of a function would be dotted with `free()` statements, one for each memory chunk allocated.
- Because the entire code dwells within the `main()` function, freeing memory isn't necessary.
- The memory allocated is freed when the program quits.
- Had the allocation taken place in a function, however, it's necessary to release the allocation or risk losing the memory chunk and potentially causing a memory overflow.
- However, we should always explicitly free the memory allocated in our program even if it is in the `main` function.
- While the operating system will reclaim the memory when the program exits, it is good practice to free all dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks and to ensure that your program is well-behaved, especially in more complex applications where memory management is critical.

```C
#define BSIZE 256

int main()
{
    const char filename[] = "pithy.txt";
    FILE *fp;

    // The buffer is used to read text from the file; the size is a guess, set as defined constant BSIZE (line 4).
    char buffer[BSIZE];
    char *r, *entry;
    int items = 0;
    int saying;
    char **list_base;

    fp = fopen(filename, "r");
    if (fp == NULL)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error opening file %s\n", filename);
        exit(1);
    }

    list_base = (char **)malloc(sizeof(char *) * 100);

    if (list_base == NULL)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Unable to allocate memory\n");
        exit(1);
    }

    // Loop as long as the file isn't empty
    while (!feof(fp))
    {
        // The variable r ensures that fgets() doesn't mess up and read beyond the end of the file; if so, the loop stops
        r = fgets(buffer, BSIZE, fp);

        if (r == NULL)
        {
            break;
        }

        // Enough storage for the string, plus one for the null character
        entry = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * strlen(buffer) + 1);

        if (entry == NULL)
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "Unable to allocate memory\n");
            exit(1);
        }

        // Copy the string from the buffer into the newly allocated memory pointed to by entry
        strcpy(entry, buffer);

        // Stores the pointer entry in the array list_base at the position indicated by items.
        *(list_base + items) = entry;
        items++;

        // Every time items is exactly divisible by 100
        // means the file read contains more than 100 lines of text, reallocate memory to prevent memory overflow
        if (items % 100 == 0)
        {
            // Existing storage is increased by 100 pointer-size chunks.
            list_base = (char **)realloc(list_base, sizeof(char *) * (items + 100));

            if (list_base == NULL)
            {
                fprintf(stderr, "Unable to reallocate memory\n");
                exit(1);
            }
        }
    }
    fclose(fp);

    // Outputs a random line of text
    srand((unsigned)time(NULL));
    saying = rand() % (items - 1);
    printf("%s", *(list_base + saying));

    // Free the allocated memory
    for (int i = 0; i < items; i++)
    {
        free(list_base[i]);
    }

    free(list_base);
    return 0;
}
```



### Similar Small Program

```C
int main(){
    char *buffer = "Hello, World!";
    char *entry = (char*)malloc(strlen(buffer) + 1);
    // Outline: For each string in buffers, memory is allocated, the string is copied, and the pointer is stored in list_base.
    strcpy(entry, buffer);
    
    
    // Now entry points to a memory location containing "Hello, World!"
    // But we need to store this pointer somewhere to access it later
    char **list_base = (char**)malloc(10 * sizeof(char *));
    int items = 0;
    
    list_base[items] = entry; // Store the pointer in the array
    
    items++;
    
    printf("%s", list_base[0]); // Prints "Hello, World!"
    printf("%s", list_base[items]); // Prints (null)
    
    // Free allocated memory
    // We don't need a loop to free the memory like the pithy program because we are only allocating and storing a single string.
    free(entry);
    free(list_base);
    return 0;
}
```

##### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `buffer` is initialized to `"Hello, World!"`.
   - `entry` is allocated enough memory to hold the string in `buffer` plus the null terminator.
   - `strcpy(entry, buffer)` copies the string from `buffer` to `entry`.
2. **Array Allocation**:
   - `list_base` is allocated memory for 10 pointers to `char`.
   - `items` is initialized to 0.
3. **Storing the Pointer**:
   - `list_base[items] = entry;` stores the pointer `entry` in `list_base[0]`.
   - `items` is incremented to 1.
4. **Printing**:
   - `printf("%s", list_base[0]);` prints the string pointed to by `list_base[0]`, which is `"Hello, World!"`.
   - `printf("%s", list_base[items]);` prints the string pointed to by `list_base[1]`, which is `NULL` because `list_base[1]` has not been initialized.

##### Why `list_base[items]` is `NULL`

- After `items` is incremented to 1, `list_base[1]` is not assigned any value. Therefore, it contains `NULL` or an undefined value.
- When you try to print `list_base[1]`, it prints `(null)` because it points to `NULL`.

##### Important Notes

If we have multiple strings like we did in the pithy program, the `list_base[items] = entry;` would be like this:

let's say our entry will have the following strings:

"Hello, World!", "John Doe", the last item is "Prince Ali"

`n` here means the last element of entry.

| list_base[0] (items = 0) | list_base[1] (items = 1) | list_base[n] (items  = n) |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| memory chunk [0]         | memory chunk [1]         | memory chunk [n]          |
| "Hello, World!"          | "John Doe"               | "Prince Ali"              |
|                          |                          |                           |



###### Memory Layout

| Index (`items`) | `list_base` Pointer              | Memory Chunk Content |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 0               | `list_base[0]`                   | "Hello, World!"      |
| 1               | `list_base[1]`                   | "John Doe"           |
| 2               | `list_base[2]` or `list_base[n]` | "Prince Ali"         |
