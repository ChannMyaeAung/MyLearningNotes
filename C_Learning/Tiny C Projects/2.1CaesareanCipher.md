## Caesarean cipher

- When `block buffering` mode is active, output doesn't appear until the buffer is full or when the program ends.
- Even if a newline appears in the stream, block buffering stores the character in the stream.
- Buffering for an I/O device is set by using the `setbuf()` function, defined in `stdio.h` header file.
- This function overrides the terminal's default line buffering and establishes block buffering using a specific chunk of memory.
- In effect, it disables line buffering for the given file handle ( or standard I/O device) and activates block buffering.

```C
int main()
{
    // A holding bin for standard output; BUFSIZ is defined in stdio.h
    char buffer[BUFSIZ];
    int a, b;

    // Commit standard output to block buffering
    setbuf(stdout, buffer);

    printf("Type a letter: ");
    // Read a single character from standard input
    a = getchar();
    printf("Type a letter: ");

    // Read the next single character from standard input
    b = getchar();

    printf("a='%c', b = '%c'\n", a, b);

    return 0;
}
```

- If we run this program, we see no output, instead the `getchar()` function prompts for input, so the program waits.
- The output is held back, stored in the character array `buffer`, waiting for text to fill the buffer or for the program to end.
- If we type `ab` at the blinking cursor, only after the Enter key is pressed, does the program end and the buffer is flushed, revealing standard output:

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
ab
Type a letter: Type a letter: a='a', b = 'b'
```

- Some C programmers use the `fflush()` function to force output or to clear the input stream which may be a workable solution but not the best.

#### Writing a simple filter

- Filters modify stream input and generate stream output.

- The `getchar()` function reads a single character from standard input.

- For most compilers, `getchar()` is a macro, equivalent to the `fgetc()` function:

  - ```C
    c = fgetc(stdin);
    ```

- The `fgetc()` function reads a single character (byte) from an open file handle. 

- On the preceding line, `stdin` is used as the standard input device. 

- The integer value returned is stored in the `int` variable `c`.

- This variable must be declared of the integer data type, not character.

- The reason is that important values, specifically the end-of-file (EOF) marker, are integer values.

- Assigning the function's return value to a `char` variable means the EOF won't be interpreted properly.

- The `putchar()` function sends a single character to standard output.

- `putchar()` is often defined as a macro that expands to the `fputc()` function.

- ```C
  r = fputc(c, stdout);
  ```

- The `fputc()` function sends an integer value `c` to the open file handle represented by `stdout`.

- The return value, `r` is the character written or EOF for an error.

- As with `fgetc()`, both variables `r` and `c` must be integers.

- In Linux, the EOF key is `Ctrl + D`.



A program to modify the input so that all vowels are detected and replaced with an asterisk.

```C
int main()
{
    // I/O deals with integers, not characters.
    int ch;

    while ((ch = getchar()) != EOF)
    {
        switch (ch)
        {
        case 'a':
        case 'A':
        case 'e':
        case 'E':
        case 'i':
        case 'I':
        case 'o':
        case 'O':
        case 'u':
        case 'U':
            putchar('*');
            break;
        default:
            putchar(ch);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
hello
h*ll*
```

- The program will keep prompting, we just have to press `Ctrl + D` to mark the EOF thus end the program.



#### Exercise 4.1

"Now that you have the basic filter skeleton in `io_filter.c`, you can perform your own
modifications, testing your filter programming skills. Here is such a challenge you can
code on your own: write a filter that converts lowercase characters to uppercase. The
effect of such a filter is to generate output in ALL CAPS."

`practice.c`

```C
int main(){
    int ch;
    
    while((ch = getchar()) != EOF){
        if(islower(ch)){
            ch = toupper(ch);
        }
        putchar(ch);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
heLlO
HELLO
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
hey hey not bad
HEY HEY NOT BAD
```



#### Exercise 4.2

"Write a filter that randomizes character text, modifying standard input to generate
output in either upper- or lowercase, regardless of the original characterâ€™s case."

```C
int main(){
    int ch, r;
    
    // Seed the randomizer
    srand((unsigned)time(NULL));
    
    while((ch = getchar()) != EOF){
        // Generate a random value, 0 to 1
        r = rand() % 2;
        
        // If r == 1, make the character uppercase
        if(r){
            putchar(toupper(ch));
        }
        // Otherwise, it is converted to lower
        else{
            putchar(tolower(ch));
        }
        
        // touppper() and tolower() affect only letters.
    }
}
```



```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Could be worse, oh wait no it couldn't.

#### Rotating 13 characters

![](/home/chan/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2024-09-30 22-21-23.png)

```C
int main()
{
    int ch;
    while ((ch = getchar()) != EOF)
    {
        // Only process alphabet characters
        if (isalpha(ch))
        {

            // Searches for "A" thru "M" or "a" thru "m"
            if (toupper(ch) >= 'A' && toupper(ch) <= 'M')
            {
                // Rotates(shift) up for the lower half of the alphabet
                ch += 13;
            }
            else
            {
                // Otherwise, rotates (shift) down
                ch -= 13;
            }
            putchar(ch);
        }
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ echo "Hail, Caesar!" | ./practice
UnvyPnrfne
```

- Because the `rot13` filter decodes and encodes the same text, we can put the program to the test through it twice.
- In the command-line construction below, text is echoed through the program once and then again.
- The result is the original text, thanks to the magic of the `rot13` process.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ echo "Hail, Caesar!" | ./practice | ./practice
HailCaesar
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ echo "Why did Caesar cross the Rubicon?" | ./practice

```

#### Devising a more Caesarean cipher

![](/home/chan/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2024-10-01 22-01-21.png)

- When a character is detected as out of range by the if statement, its value must be reduced by 26, wrapping it back to 'A' or 'a', depending on the letter's original case.
- Due to the proximity of uppercase 'Z' to lowercase 'a', this if statement test works because this particular shift is only three characters.
- From figure 4.7, we can see that the ASCII table sets only six characters between uppercase Z and lowercase a.
- For larger character shifts, more complex testing must be performed.

```C
int main(){
    int shift,ch;
    
    //Shifts from A to D which is done backward here because math
    shift = 'D' - 'A';
    
    while((ch = getchar()) != EOF){
        // Only process alphabet characters
        if(isalpha(ch)){
            // Shift the letter
            ch += shift;
            
            // Determines whether the new character is out of range
            if((ch > 'Z' && ch < 'a') || ch > 'z'){
                // If so, adjusts its value back within range
                ch -= 26;
            }
        }
    }
    
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Now is the time for all good men...
Qrz lv wkh wlph iru doo jrrg phq...
```

- Unlike with a `rot13` filter, we can't run the same program twice to decode the A-to-D shift.
- Instead, to decode the message, we must shift from D back to A.
- Two changes are required to make this change.

```C
shift = 'A' - 'D';
```

- Second, the out-of-bounds testing must check the underside of the alphabet, so see whether a character's value has dipped below 'A' or 'a':

```C
if(ch < 'A' || (ch > 'Z' && ch < 'a')){
    ch += 26;
}
```

- If the character wraps on the underside of the alphabet, its value is increased by 26, which wraps it back up to the Z end, correcting the overflow.



```C
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int shift, ch;
    char a, b;

    // If fewer than 3 arguments are provided, default shift is 13.
    if (argc < 3)
    {
        shift = 13;
    }
    else
    {
        // Get the first characters of the second and third arguments
        a = argv[2][0];
        b = argv[1][0];

        // Check if both characters are alphabetic
        if (isalpha(a) && isalpha(b))
        {
            // Convert both to uppercase
            a = toupper(a);
            b = toupper(b);

            // calculate the shift value
            shift = a - b;

            // Ensure the shift is within the range -25 to 25
            if (shift < -25 || shift > 25)
            {
                shift = 13;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            shift = 13;
        }
    }

    // Read characters from standard input until EOF
    while ((ch = getchar()) != EOF)
    {
        //If the character is an uppercase letter
        if (isupper(ch))
        {
            // Shift the letter
            ch += shift;

            // Adjusts appropriately for overflow in either direction
            // Adjust for overflow beyond 'Z'
            if (ch > 'Z')
                ch -= 26;
            // Adjust for overflow below 'A'
            if (ch < 'A')
                ch += 26;
            putchar(ch);
        }
        // If it is a lowercase letter
        else if (islower(ch))
        {
            ch += shift;
            if (ch > 'z')
                ch -= 26;
            if (ch < 'a')
                ch += 26;
            putchar(ch);
        }
        // If the character is not a letter, print it as is
        else
        {
            putchar(ch);
        }
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}

```

- **Shift Calculation**:
  - If fewer than 3 arguments are provided, the shift is set to 13.
  - If 3 or more arguments are provided, the first characters of the second and third arguments are used to calculate the shift.
  - For example, if the arguments are `./practice A D`, `a` is 'D' and `b` is 'A'. The shift is calculated as `shift = 'D' - 'A' = 3`.
- **Processing Each Character**:
  - For each character read:
    - If it is an uppercase letter (e.g., 'T'):
      - The character is shifted by the calculated shift value.
      - Adjustments are made if the shifted character goes beyond 'Z' or below 'A'.
    - If it is a lowercase letter (e.g., 'h'):
      - The character is shifted by the calculated shift value.
      - Adjustments are made if the shifted character goes beyond 'z' or below 'a'.
    - If it is not a letter (e.g., space ' '), it is printed as is.

##### Summary:

- The program calculates the shift based on the difference between the first characters of the second and third command-line arguments.
- It then reads input characters, shifts alphabetic characters by the calculated amount, and prints the modified characters.
- Non-alphabetic characters are printed as is.
- The shift value can be positive or negative, depending on the order of the command-line arguments.

#### Building the hex output filter

```C

    while ((ch = getchar()) != EOF)
    {
        // Outputs character as two-digit hex byte, with a leading zero.
        printf("%0.2X ", ch);
        wrap += 3; // Each printf() output is 3 characters wide

        // Assume that the terminal column width is 80
        // 77 because 77 + 3 = 80
        if (wrap > 77 || ch == '\n')
        {
            // Output a newline
            putchar('\n');
            // Reset the wrap value
            wrap = 0;

##### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `word` buffer is empty.
   - `offset` is 0.
2. **Processing "Is"**:
   - 'I' is stored in `word[0]`, `offset` becomes 1.
   - 's' is stored in `word[1]`, `offset` becomes 2.
   - Space ' ' is encountered:
     - `word[2]` is set to `'\0'`.
     - `printf("%s\n", word)` prints "Is".
     - `offset` is reset to 0.
3. **Processing "this"**:
   - 't' is stored in `word[0]`, `offset`becomes 1.
   - 'h' is stored in `word[1]`, `offset` becomes 2.
   - 'i' is stored in `word[2]`, `offset` becomes 3.
   - 's' is stored in `word[3]`, `offset` becomes 4.
   - Space ' ' is encountered:
     - `word[4]` is set to `'\0'`.
     - `printf("%s\n", word)` prints "this".
     - `offset` is reset to 0.
4. **Processing "still"**:

##### Notes

- It is vital that all strings in C end with the null character, `\0`, especially when we build our own strings, as done in the above program, confirm that the string that's created is capped.
- If not, we get an overflow and all kinds of ugly output and potentially bad things happening.
