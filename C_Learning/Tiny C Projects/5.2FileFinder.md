## Chapter 11 - File Finder

- Suppose we want to locate a file named `budget.csv`, located somewhere in our home directory tree.

```bash
find ~ -name budget.csv -print
```

- The pathname is `~`, shortcut for our home directory.
- The `-name` switch identifies the file to locate, `budget.csv`.
- The final switch, `-print` (the one everyone forgets), directs the `find` command to send the results to standard output.
- The other file-finding command is `grep`.

```shell
grep -r "time_t" *
```

- The `-r` switch directs `grep` to recursively look through directories.
- The string to find is `time_t` and the `*` wildcard directs the program to search all filenames.



### Coding the Find File utility

`hello.h`

```C
#ifndef HELLO_H
#define HELLO_H

#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

#ifndef PATH_MAX
#define PATH_MAX 256
#endif

extern int count;

enum
{
    ERROR_CODE = -1,
    BSIZE = 32,
    TRUE,
    FALSE,
};

void findFile(char *dirpath, char *parentpath, char *match);

#endif // HELLO_H
```

`hello.c`

```C
int count = 0;

void findFile(char *dirpath, char *parentpath, char *match){
    DIR *dp;
    struct dirent *entry;
    struct stat fs;
    const char *filename;
    char subdirpath[PATH_MAX];
    
    dp = opendir(dirpath);
    if(dp == NULL){
        fprintf(stderr, "Unable to read directory '%s'\n", dirpath);
        exit(1);
    }
    
    while((entry = readdir(dp)) != NULL){
        filename = entry->d_name;
        
        // Performs a comparison for the filename found with the passed filename
        if(strcmp(filename, match) == 0){
            printf("%s/%s\n", dirpath, match);
            count++;
        }
        
        stat(filename, &fs);
        if(S_ISDIR(fs.st_mode)){
            
            // Avoid checking the hidden files
            if(strncmp(filename, ".", 1) == 0){
                continue;
            }
            if(chdir(filename) == -1){
                fprintf(stderr, "Unable to change to %s\n", filename);
                exit(1);
            }
            
            getcwd(subdirpath, BUFSIZ);
            
            // The recursive call, again with the passed filename to match as the third argument
            findFile(subdirpath, dirpath, match);
        }
    }
    
    closedir(dp);
    
    if(chdir(parentpath) == -1){
        if(parentpath == NULL){
            return;
        }
        
        fprintf(stderr, "Parent directory lost\n");
        exit(1);
    }
}
```

`main.c`

- The `main()` function's job is to fetch the filename from the command line, retrieve the current path, make the call to the `find()` function, and then report the results.

```C
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    char current[PATH_MAX];
    if(argc < 2){
        fprintf(stderr, "Format: ff filename\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    
    getcwd(current, PATH_MAX);
    if(chdir(current) == -1){
        fprintf(stderr, "Unable to access directory %s\n", current);
        exit(1);
    }
    
    count = 0;
    printf("Searching for '%s'\n", argv[1]);
    findFile(current, NULL, argv[1]);
    
    // Report the results
    printf(" Found %d match", count);
    
    // Adds "es" for any count value other than 1
    if(count != 1){
        print("es");
    }
    
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}
```



```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final *.c
Searching for 'hello.c'
/home/chan/C_Programming/test/hello.c
 Found 1 match
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final libs
Searching for 'libs'
/home/chan/C_Programming/test/libs
 Found 1 match
```

- The utility attempts to locate all files with the `.c` extension in the current directory.
- Rather than return them all, we see only the first match reported: `hello.c`.
- The problem here is that the code doesn't recognize wildcards; it finds only specific filenames.
- To match files with wildcards, we must understand something known as the glob.



### Understanding the glob

- `glob` is short for `global` in the computer world.
- Specifically, `glob` is a way to use wildcards to specify or match filenames.
- The term is `glob`, the process is `globbing`.
- The C library function worthy of attention is `glob()`.

As a review, the filename wildcards are:

- `?` to match a single character
- `*` to match a group of more than one character



- In Windows, globbing takes place automatically. But in the Linux environment, the glob feature must be activated for wildcards to expand.
- If not, the `*` and `?` wildcards are interpreted literally, which isn't what most users expect.
- To ensure that globbing is active, type the `set -o` command. In the output, the `noglob` option should be set to `off`:

```shell
noglob         	off
```

- When globbing is active, the shell expands the `?` and `*` wildcards to match files.



```C
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    int x;
    
    if(argc > 1){
        for(x = 1; x < argc; x++){
            printf("%s\n", argv[x]);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```



`Output`

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final this that the other
this
that
the
other
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final *.c
hello.c
main.c
```

- We can see the the program dutifully echoes all command-line options in the first run.
- In the second run, with a wildcard specified, the program outputs all the files in that directory which ends with `.c` extension.
- The `*.c`  wildcard(globby thing) is expanded by the shell, which feeds each matching filename from the current directory to the program as a command-line argument.
- Instead of a single argument, `*.c`, multiple arguments are supplied.



```C
int glob(const char *pattern, int flags, int (*errfunc) (const char *epath, int eerrno), glob_t *pglob);
```

- `const char *pattern` is a pathname wildcard pattern to match.
- `int flags` are options to customize the function's behavior, usually a series of defined constants logically OR'd together.
- `int (*errfunc)` is the name of an error-handling function (along with its two arguments), which is necessary because the `glob()` function can be quirky. Specify NULL to use the default error handler.
- `glob_t *pglob` is a structure containing details about the matching files. 
  - Two useful members are `gl_pathc`, which lists the number of matching files.
  - `gl_pathv`, which serves as the base of a pointer list referencing matching filenames in the current directory.
- The `glob()` function returns zero on success. Other return values include defined constants we can test to determine whether the function screwed up or failed to find any matching files.
- We must include `glob.h` header file.

```C
typedef struct {
    size_t gl_pathc;    // Count of paths matched by the pattern
    char **gl_pathv;    // List of matched pathnames
    size_t gl_offs;     // Slots to reserve at the beginning of gl_pathv
    // Other members...
} glob_t;
```



`hello.h`

```C
#include <limits.h>

#ifndef PATH_MAX
#define PATH_MAX 256
#endif
```



```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(){
    char filename[PATH_MAX]; // Pointer to the result of fgets
    char *r; // Pointer to the result of fgets
    int g; // the return value of glob()
    glob_t gstruct; // The structure specified in the glob() func
    char **found; // A double-pointer to the list of matching filenames
    
    printf("Filename or wildcard: ");
    r = fgets(filename, PATH_MAX, stdin);
    if(r == NULL){
        exit(1);
    }
    
    // Remove the newline character from the input
    while(*r != '\0'){

            break;
        }
        r++;
    }
    
     // Use glob to find matching filenames
    // The call to the glob() function, mostly defaults except for the GLOB_ERR flag
    g = glob(filename, GLOB_ERR, NULL, &gstruct);
    
    // Checks for errors, specifically no matching filename
    if(g != 0){
        if(g == GLOB_NOMATCH){
            fprintf(stderr, "No matches for '%s'\n", filename);
        }else{
            fprintf(stderr, "Some kinda glob error\n");
        }
        exit(1);
    }
    
    // Outputs the matches using structure member gl_pathc; the placeholder %zu is used for a size_t value
    printf("Found %zu filename matches\n", gstruct.gl_pathc); // Print the number of matches found
    
    // The gl_pathv member is the base of a pointer list, assigned to double pointer found
    found = gstruct.gl_pathv; // Get the list of matched filenames
    
    // Loops as long as the string referenced by *found isn't NULL
    // Iterate over the matched filenames and print each one
    while(*found){
        
        // Outputs the matching filename
        printf("%s\n", *found);
        
        // Increments the found pointer to reference the next item in the list
        found++;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```



`Output`

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Filename or wildcard: hello*
Found 2 filename matches

hello.h
```

- Having the `glob()` function in the program allows wildcards to be used effectively.



### The duplicate file finder

- The process of creating a `Find Dupe` utility borrows heavily from the subdirectory scanning tools presented in chapter 10 and used earlier in this chapter.
- But the rest of the code - recording and scanning the list of saved files - is a new territory: a list of files must be created.
- The list must be scanned for duplicates and then the duplicates output, along with their pathnames.



### Building a file list

- The option to build a list of files found in subdirectories is to create a linked list.
- A linked list structure must have as a member a pointer to the next item, or node, in the list.
- This member becomes part of the structure that stores found filenames and their paths.

```C
struct finfo{
    int index;
    char name[BUFSIZ];
    char path[PATH_MAX];
    struct finfo *next;
}
```

This structure contains four members:

- `index`, which keeps a count of the files found (avoiding an external variable)
- `name`, which contains the name of the found file
- `path`, which contains the full path to the file
- `next`, which references the next node in the linked list, or NULL for the end of the list

This structure must be declared externally so that all functions in the code understand its definition.

In the next listing, the `main()` function allocates the first node in the linked list. 

- The structure must be empty; it's the recursive function `findFile()` that builds the linked list.
- The `main()` function fetches the starting directory for a call to the recursive function.
- Upon completion, a `while` loop outputs the names of the files referenced by the linked list.

`main.c`

```C
int main(){
    char startdir[PATH_MAX];
    
    // A pointer is needed for the base (first) and for examining the items in the list (current)
    struct finfo *first, *current;
    
    first = malloc(sizeof(struct finfo) * 1);
    if(first == NULL){
        fprintf(stderr, "Unable to allocate memory\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    
    // Fills the first node with empty values
    first->index = 0;
    strcpy(first->name, "");
    strcpy(first->path, "");
    first->next = NULL;
    
    // Obtail the current directory for the findFile() call
    getcwd(startdir, PATH_MAX);
    
    if(chdir(startdir) == -1){
        fprintf(stderr, "Unable to access directory %s\n", startdir);
        exit(1);
    }
    
    // Calls the recursive function
    findFile(startdir, NULL, first);
    
    // Sets the current pointer to the start of the list
    current = start;
    
    // Loops as long as the current pointer isn't NULL
    while(current){
        // Skip over the first item in the list, zero
        if(current->index > 0){
            
            // Output the index value, pathname, and filename
            printf("%d:%s/%s\n", current->index, current->path, current->name);
        }
        
        // Reference the next item in the list
        current = current->next;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```



- The third argument of the `findFile()` function is replaced by a pointer to the current node in the linked list.
- The function's job is to create new nodes, filling their structures as it finds files in the current directory.

`hello.h`

```C
struct finfo{
    int index;
    char name[BUFSIZ];
    char path[PATH_MAX];
    struct finfo *next;
};

struct finfo *findFile(char *dirpath, char *parentpath, struct finfo *f){
    
}
```

`hello.c`

```C
struct finfo *find(char *dirpath, char *parentpath, struct finfo *f){
    DIR *dp;
    struct dirent *entry;
    struct stat fs;
    const char *filename;
    char subdirpath[PATH_MAX];
    int i;
    
    dp = opendir(dirpath);
    if(dp == NULL){
        fprintf(stderr, "Unable to read directory '%s'\n", dirpath);
        exit(1);
    }
    
    while((entry = readdir(dp)) != NULL){
        filename = entry->d_name;
        stat(filename, &fs);
        
        // Test for a subdirectory and recursion
        if(S_ISDIR(fs.st_mode)){
            // Skip the hidden files
            if(strncmp(filename, ".", 1) == 0){
                continue;
            }
            if(chdir(filename) == -1){
                fprintf(stderr, "Unable to change to %s\n", filename);
                exit(1);
            }
            
            getcwd(subdirpath, BUFSIZ);
            
            // The recursive call must capture the function's return value
            f = findFile(subdirpath, dirpath, f);
        }else{ // If not a subdirectory, saves the file information
            // Allocates the next node in the linked list
            f->next = malloc(sizeof(struct finfo) * 1);
            if(f->next == NULL){
                fprintf(stderr, "Unable to allocate new structure\n");
                exit(1);
            }
            
            // Saves the current index value
            i = f->index;
            
            // Reference the freshly allocated node
            f = f->next;
            
            // update the index value
            f->index = i + 1;
            
            // Saves the filename
            strcpy(f->name, filename);
            
            // Saves the pathname
            strcpy(f->path, dirpath);
            
            // Initiate the next pointer;
            f->next = NULL;
        }
    }
    
    closedir(dp);
    
    if(chdir(parentpath) == -1){
        if(parentpath == NULL){
            return f;
        }
        fprintf(stderr, "Parent directory lost\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    
    return f;
}
```

- The `findFile()` function makes a simple decision based on whether a directory entry is a subdirectory or a file.
- When a subdirectory is found, the function is recursively called.
- Otherwise, a new node in the linked list is allocated and the file entry information is recorded.

### Locating the duplicates

- The purpose of creating a linked list in the Find Dupe program is to find duplicates.
- At some point, the list must be scanned and a determination made as to which filenames are repeated and in which directories the duplicates are found.

```C
struct finfo{
    int index;
    int repeat; // New member to track repeated filenames
    char name[BUFSIZ];
    char path[PATH_MAX];
    struct finfo *next;
}
```

- The `repeat` member tracks how many times a name repeats.
- Its value is initialized to one in the `findFile()` function as each node is created.
- After all, every filename found exists at least once.
- To track repeated filenames, the `repeat` member is incremented as the list is scanned after its creation.
- In the `main()` function, a nested loop works like a bubble sort. 
- It compares each node in the list sequentially with the rest of the nodes.
- To perform the second scan, we need another `struct finfo` variable declared in the `main()` function.
- This variable, `*scan`,  is used in addition to `*first` and `*current` to scan the linked list:

```C
struct finfo *first, *current, *scan;
```

- The nested `while` loop is added just before the `while` loop that outputs the list. This nested loop uses the `*current` pointer to process the entire linked list.
- The `*scan` pointer is used in an inner `while` loop to compare the `current->name` member with subsequent `name` members.
- When a match is found, the `current->repeat` structure member for the file with the repeated name is incremented.

```C
current = first;

while(current){
    if(current->index > 0){
        // obtain the address of the next entry, where the scanning starts
        scan = current->next;
        
        // Loop until scan references the final (NULL) node in the list
        while(scan){
            
            // Compares the filenames
            if(strncmp(current->name, scan->name) == 0){
                // If the names are identical, increments the repeat counter for the current entry.
                current->repeat++;
            }
            
            // Continues the scan
            scan = scan->next;
        }
    }
    
    // Continue incrementing through the entire list, comparing each node with the rest of the list
    current = current->next;
}
```

- These nested loops update the `repeat` member of structures containing identical filenames.
- They are followed by the existing `while` loop that outputs the list.
- The `printf()` statement in that second loop is updated to output the `repeat` value:

```C
printf("%d:%s/%s (%d)\n", current->index, current->path, current->name, current->repeat);
```
