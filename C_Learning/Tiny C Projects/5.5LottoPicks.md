## Chapter 14 - Lotto picks

### Understanding the odds

**Some math formula-things explain the odds**

```
Probability of winning = Chances of winning / Chances of winning + Chances of losing

Odds of winning = Chances of losing : Chances of winning
```

Suppose that we're betting on the roll of a die. Here is how we would calculate our odds of guessing the right number, one out of six:

```
odds = 1 / (1 + 5) = 1 / 6 = 0.166...
```

- we have a 16.6% chance of guessing correctly.
- To calculate the odds of losing, change the numerator in the top equation so that **Chances of losing** replaces **Chances of winning**.

```
odds = 5 / (1 + 5) = 5 / 6 = 0.833...
```

- We have an 83.3% chance of losing.
- For the dice example, the odds of winning are 1 in 5, often expressed as 5:1 or "five to 1".
- The odds aren't 1:6 because one of the choices wins but five lose.
- Therefore, the odds are expressed 5:1 with the same win/lose percentages: 16.6 and 83.3.



### Programming the odds

```C
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int ow, ol; // ow = odds of winning, ol = odds of losing

    printf("Chances of happening: ");
    scanf("%d", &ow);
    printf("Chances of not happening: ");
    scanf("%d", &ol);

    printf("Your odds of winning are %2.1f%%, or %d:%d\n", (float)ow / (float)(ow + ol) * 100, ow, ol);
    return (0);
}
```

`Output`

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Chances of happening: 1
Chances of not happening: 5
Your odds of winning are 16.7%, or 1:5
```

- If we guess one of the six sides of a die, the chances of it happening are one, and the chances of it not happening are five.
- The odds of winning are 16.7%, or one in five.
- Say we want to calculate the odds of drawing a heart from a deck of cards:

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Chances of happening: 13
Chances of not happening: 39
Your odds of winning are 25.0%, or 13:39
```

- Because hearts is one of four suits, the odds are 25% or one in four though the program doesn't reduce the ratio.

- Another example is a game like Powerball, the odds are calculated as numbers are drawn but also considering that the balls aren't drawn in any order.

  - These items must be considered to properly calculate the odds.
  - For example, if we could bet on only one ball, the odds are 68:1 or 1 / (68 + 1), which is 1.45 percent chance of winning. 
  - If we bet on drawing two balls, the odds for the second ball become 67:1 and then 66:1 for the third ball, and so on.
  - If your guesses are 1,2,3,5 and 8, the first ball could be any of those numbers.
  - The second ball could be any four of those numbers and so on.
  - The number of balls from which the numbers are drawn - 69, 68, 67, 66, 65 - must be divided by 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, or 5! (five factorial):

  ```
  (69 * 68 * 67 * 66 * 65) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 11,238,513
  ```

  - Our chance of correctly picking five numbers from a 69-ball lottery is 1:11,268,513.

- To calculate multiple draws, as in a lottery, more math is required. 

- The decreasing number of balls must be multiplied, as well as permutations of the number guessed.

- The product of the total items is calculated in variable `i`; the product of the items to draw is calculated in variable `d`.



```C
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int items, draw, x;

    // even an unsigned long value may not be large enough to handle the odds for some calculations
    unsigned long long i, d;

    printf("Number of items: ");
    scanf("%d", &items);
    printf("Items to draw: ");
    scanf("%d", &draw);

    i = items;
    d = draw;

    // loop thru the number of draws
    for (x = 1; x < draw; x++)
    {

        // obtain the product of each item, decreasing in value
        i *= items - x;

        // Obtain the product of each drawing permutation, decreasing in value
        d *= draw - x;
    }

    printf("Your odds of drawing %d ", draw);
    printf("items from %d are: \n", items);
    printf("\t1:%.0f\n", (float)i / (float)d); // cast the variable to obtain an accurate result
    return (0);
}
```

`Output`

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Number of items: 69
Items to draw: 5
Your odds of drawing 5 items from 69 are: 
	1:11238513

```



**Exercise 14.1**

Modify the code to confirm that the input of either value isn't 0, and that the number of items drawn doesn't exceed the number of items available.

```C
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int items, draw, x;

    // even an unsigned long value may not be large enough to handle the odds for some calculations
    unsigned long long i, d;

    printf("Number of items: ");
    scanf("%d", &items);
    printf("Items to draw: ");
    scanf("%d", &draw);

    i = items;
    d = draw;

    if (items < draw)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "You cannot draw more items than you have.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    if (i <= 0 || d <= 0)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "You cannot draw 0 or less items.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // loop thru the number of draws
    for (x = 1; x < draw; x++)
    {

        // obtain the product of each item, decreasing in value
        i *= items - x;

        // Obtain the product of each drawing permutation, decreasing in value
        d *= draw - x;
    }

    printf("Your odds of drawing %d ", draw);
    printf("items from %d are: \n", items);
    printf("\t1:%.0f\n", (float)i / (float)d); // cast the variable to obtain an accurate result
    return (0);
}
```

`Output`

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Number of items: 0
Items to draw: 0
You cannot draw 0 or less items.
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Number of items: 10
Items to draw: 12
You cannot draw more items than you have.
```

**Exercise 14.2**

Add commas to the odds number output. 

```
1:11238513 -> 1:11,238,513
```



```C
void print_with_commas(unsigned long long n)
{
     // Base case: If the number is less than 1000, print it directly.
    if (n < 1000)
    {
        printf("%llu", n);
        return;
    }
    else
    {
        // Recursive case: Process higher-order digits.
        print_with_commas(n / 1000);
        
        // Print a comma followed by the last three digits with leading zeros if necessary.
        printf(",%03llu", n % 1000);
    }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int items, draw, x;

    // even an unsigned long value may not be large enough to handle the odds for some calculations
    unsigned long long i, d;

    printf("Number of items: ");
    scanf("%d", &items);
    printf("Items to draw: ");
    scanf("%d", &draw);

    i = items;
    d = draw;

    if (items < draw)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "You cannot draw more items than you have.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    if (i <= 0 || d <= 0)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "You cannot draw 0 or less items.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // loop thru the number of draws
    for (x = 1; x < draw; x++)
    {

        // obtain the product of each item, decreasing in value
        i *= items - x;

        // Obtain the product of each drawing permutation, decreasing in value
        d *= draw - x;
    }

    unsigned long long odds = i / d;

    printf("Your odds of drawing %d ", draw);
    printf("items from %d are: \n", items);
    printf("\t1:");
    print_with_commas(odds);
    printf("\n");
    return (0);
}
```

1. **Display Odds with Commas:**
   - The function `print_with_commas(odds)` is called with let's assume `odds = 13,983,870`.
   - **Function Execution:**
     - **First Call (`n = 13,983,870`):**
       - Since `n >= 1000`, recursively call with `n / 1000`.
     - **Second Call (`n = 13,983`):**
       - Since `n >= 1000`, recursively call with `n / 1000`.
     - **Third Call (`n = 13`):**
       - Since `n < 1000`, print `13`.
     - **Back to Second Call:**
       - Print `,` and `983` with leading zeros: `,983`
     - **Back to First Call:**
       - Print `,` and `870` with leading zeros: `,870`
   - **Final Output:**
     - Prints `13,983,870`

**Author's Solution**

```C
char *commify(float bignum){
    const int size = 128; /* large enough */
    char string[size]; /* original string */
    static char commas[size]; // commified string
    int len, s, c;
    
    // store the value as a string
    snprintf(string, size, "%.0f", bignum);
    len = strlen(string);
    s = c = 0;
    
    // if the number is zero or negative
    if(bignum < 1){
        strcpy(commas, "0"); // return zero
        return commas;
    }
    
    // If number is less than 1000, no need to add any commas
    if(bignum < 1000){
        strcpy(commas, string); // just copy the string
        return commas;
    }
    
    // loop thru the number stored in string
    while(string[s]){
        // add a comma every third character after the initial character
        if(len % 3 == 0 && c > 0){
            commas[c] = ',';
            c++;
        }
        
        // otherwise, copy the character
        commas[c++] = string[s++];
        len--;
    }
    return commas;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int items, draw, x;

    // even an unsigned long value may not be large enough to handle the odds for some calculations
    unsigned long long i, d;

    printf("Number of items: ");
    scanf("%d", &items);
    printf("Items to draw: ");
    scanf("%d", &draw);

    i = items;
    d = draw;

    if (items < draw)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "You cannot draw more items than you have.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    if (i <= 0 || d <= 0)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "You cannot draw 0 or less items.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // loop thru the number of draws
    for (x = 1; x < draw; x++)
    {

        // obtain the product of each item, decreasing in value
        i *= items - x;

        // Obtain the product of each drawing permutation, decreasing in value
        d *= draw - x;
    }

    unsigned long long odds = i / d;

    printf("Your odds of drawing %d ", draw);
    printf("items from %d are: \n", items);
    printf("\t1:%s\n", commify((float)i / (float)d)); // cast the variable to obtain an accurate result
    return (0);
}
```



`Output`

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Number of items: 69
Items to draw: 5
Your odds of drawing 5 items from 69 are: 
	1:11,238,513
```



### Generating random values

- The required tool is the `rand()` function, prototyped in the `stdlib.h` header file:

```C
int rand(void);
```

- The function takes no arguments and returns an integer value in the range zero through `RAND_MAX`.
- The next code spews out a grid of random numbers, five rows by five columns.
- The `rand()` function generates the value saved in variable `r` and output in a `printf()` statement.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(){
    const int rows = 5;
    int x, y, r;
    
    for(x = 0; x < rows; x++){
        for(y = 0; y < rows; y++){
            r = rand();
            printf("%d ", r);
        }
        putchar('\n');
    }
    return 0;
}
```

- The program generates 25 random values, and the output is completely ugly.

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
1804289383 846930886 1681692777 1714636915 1957747793 
424238335 719885386 1649760492 596516649 1189641421 
1025202362 1350490027 783368690 1102520059 2044897763 
1967513926 1365180540 1540383426 304089172 1303455736 
35005211 521595368 294702567 1726956429 336465782 
```

- The numbers are huge, which is within the range generated by the `rand()` function, from zero through `RAND_MAX`.
- To output values in a different range, we can employ the modulo operator.

```C
value = rand() % range;
```

- The variable `value` is between 0 and the value of `range`.
- If we want the value to be between 1 and `range`,

```C
value = rand() % range + 1;
```



```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(){
    const int rows = 5;
    int x, y, r;
    
    for(x = 0; x < rows; x++){
        for(y = 0; y < rows; y++){
            r = rand() % 100 + 1;
            printf("%3d ", r);
        }
        putchar('\n');
    }
    return 0;
}
```

- The first statement limits the `rand()` function's output to the range of 1 through 100.
- The second statement aligns output, restricting the value to a three-character-wide frame, followed by a space.

`Output`

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
 84  87  78  16  94 
 36  87  93  50  22 
 63  28  91  60  64 
 27  41  27  73  37 
 12  69  68  30  83 
```



#### `srand()` function

However, there is an issue. If we run the program twice, the same numbers are generated. 

- The result doesn't bode well for our lottery picks because the desire is to be random.

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
 84  87  78  16  94 
 36  87  93  50  22 
 63  28  91  60  64 
 27  41  27  73  37 
 12  69  68  30  83 
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
 84  87  78  16  94 
 36  87  93  50  22 
 63  28  91  60  64 
 27  41  27  73  37 
 12  69  68  30  83 
```

- The solution is to use `srand()`.

```C
void srand(unsigned int seed);
```

- The seed argument is a positive integer value, which the `rand()` function uses in its random-number calculations.
- The `srand()` function needs to be called only once.
- It's often used with the `time()` function, which returns the current clock-tick value as a seed.

```C
srand((unsigned)time(NULL));
```

- The `time()` function is typecast to `unsigned` and given the NULL argument.
- This format ensures that the clock-tick value is properly consumed by the `srand()` function, and a new slate of random numbers is generated every time the program runs.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    const int rows = 5;
    int x, y, r;
    srand((unsigned)time(NULL));
    for (x = 0; x < rows; x++)
    {
        for (y = 0; y < rows; y++)
        {
            r = rand() % 100 + 1;
            printf("%3d ", r);
        }
        putchar('\n');
    }
    return (0);
}
```



`Output`

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
 19  17  69  72  12 
 37  19  34   2  13 
 39   7  29  75  64 
 16  30  97  77  60 
 90  70  16  43  18 
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
 57  32  41  61  75 
 30  23  64  98  64 
 79   9  84  10  62 
 11  46  83  27  53 
 81  77  64   7  99 

```



### Drawing lotto balls

- A `for` loop fills the array with random values.
- Next, a nested `for` loop works like a bubble sort to compare each value in the array with other values.
- When two values match, the second is replaced with a new random value, and the loop is reset to scan again.

```C
int main(){
    
    // set the constants to represent total balls and number to draw
    const int balls = 69, draw = 5;
    int x, r;
    int winners[draw];
    
    srand((unsigned)time(NULL));
    
    printf("Drawing %d numbers from %d balls:\n", draw, balls);
    
    for(x = 0; x < draw; x++){
        // five random numbers in the range from 1 thru 69.
        winners[x] = rand() % balls + 1;
    }
    
    // THe outer loop moves thru the array to the next-to-last element, draw - 1
    for(x = 0; x < draw - 1; x++){
        //The inner loop moves thru the array from the x + 1 element to the last element
        for(y = x + 1; y < draw; y++){
            if(winners[x] == winners[y]){
                winners[y] = rand() % balls + 1;
                y = draw;
                x = -1;
            }
        }
    }
    for(x = 0; x < draw; x++){
        printf("%2d\n", winners[x]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```



`Output`

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Drawing 5 numbers from 69 balls:
58

chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice

**Exercise 14.3**

The output from the program looks nothing like the back of a fortune cookie fortune. Two ways to improve it are to sort the numbers and output them on a single line to improve readability.

```shell
Drawing 5 numbers from 69 balls:
5 - 10 - 14 - 33
```

**Solution**

```C
//a and b are const void * pointers, which need to be cast to int * for dereferencing.
int compare(const void *a, const void *b){
    return (*(int *)a - *(int *)b);
}

int main(){
    const int balls = 69, draw = 5;
    int x, y;
    int winners[draw];
    
    srand((unsigned)time(NULL));
    
    printf("Drawing %d numbers from %d balls:\n", draw, balls);
    
    // Generate random numbers
    for(x = 0; x < draw; x++){
        winners[x] = rand() % balls + 1;
    }
    
    // Ensure all numbers are unique
    for(x = 0; x < draw - 1; y++){
        for(y = x + 1; y < draw; y++){
            if(winners[x] == winners[y]){
                winners[y] = rand() % balls + 1; // Replace duplicate with a new random number
                y = draw; // Restart the inner loop
                x = -1; // Restart the outer loop

            }
        }
    }
    
    qsort(winners, draw, sizeof(int), compare);
    
    for(X = 0; x < draw; x++){
        if(x == draw - 1){
            printf("%2d\n", winners[x]);
        }else{
            printf("%2d - ", winners[x]);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

- ```C
  qsort(winners, draw, sizeof(int), compare);
  ```

- **Purpose:** Sorts the `winners` array in ascending order using the `qsort` function.

  **Parameters:**

  - `winners`: Array to sort.
  - `draw`: Number of elements in the array.
  - `sizeof(int)`: Size of each element.
  - `compare`: Function to compare two elements.

  **Code Breakdown**

  **Outer Loop (`x`):**

  ```C
  for (x = 0; x < draw - 1; x++)
  ```

  - **Purpose:** Iterates over each element in the `winners` array.
  - **`x`:** Represents the index of the current number being checked for duplicates.

  #### **Inner Loop (`y`):**

  ```c
  for (y = x + 1; y < draw; y++)
  ```

  - **Purpose:** Compares `winners[x]` with all subsequent numbers in the array (`winners[y]`).
  - **`y`:** Represents the index of the number being compared to `winners[x]`.

  #### **Duplicate Check:**

  ```c
  if (winners[x] == winners[y]) // Check for duplicates
  ```

  - Compares the current number `winners[x]` with `winners[y]`.
  - If they are the same, a duplicate is detected.

  #### **Replace Duplicate and Restart:**

  ```c
  winners[y] = rand() % balls + 1; // Replace duplicate with a new random number
  y = draw; // Exit the inner loop (force restart)
  x = -1;   // Exit the outer loop (force restart from the beginning)
  ```

  - Generate a New Random Number:
    - Replace `winners[y]` with a new random number (`rand() % balls + 1`).
  - Restart Inner Loop (`y = draw`):
    - Forces the inner loop to exit by setting `y` to `draw` (breaking the condition `y < draw`).
  - Restart Outer Loop (`x = -1`):
    - Forces the outer loop to restart from the beginning on the next iteration (`x` will increment to `0`).

  ### **Example Walkthrough**

  #### **Initial Setup:**

  - Let `balls = 10`,  `draw = 5`, and the initial random numbers be:

    ```c
    winners = [3, 7, 3, 9, 5];
    ```

  - This array contains a duplicate (`3` appears twice).

  ------

  #### **Step-by-Step Execution**

  1. **Outer Loop (`x = 0`):**

     - `winners[0] = 3`.

     **Inner Loop (`y = 1` to `4`):**

     - `winners[1] = 7`: No match.

     - `winners[2] = 3`: 

       Duplicate found!

       - Replace `winners[2]` with a new random number, e.g., `4`.
       - Array becomes: `[3, 7, 4, 9, 5]`.
       - Restart loops (`y = draw`, `x = -1`).

  ------

  1. **Outer Loop Restarts (`x = 0`):**

     - `winners[0] = 3`.

     **Inner Loop (`y = 1` to `4`):**

     - `winners[1] = 7`: No match.
     - `winners[2] = 4`: No match.
     - `winners[3] = 9`: No match.
     - `winners[4] = 5`: No match.

  ------

  1. **Outer Loop (`x = 1`):**

     - `winners[1] = 7`.

     **Inner Loop (`y = 2` to `4`):**

     - `winners[2] = 4`: No match.
     - `winners[3] = 9`: No match.
     - `winners[4] = 5`: No match.

  ------

  1. **Outer Loop (`x = 2`):**

     - `winners[2] = 4`.

     **Inner Loop (`y = 3` to `4`):**

     - `winners[3] = 9`: No match.
     - `winners[4] = 5`: No match.

  ------

  1. **Outer Loop (`x = 3`):**

     - `winners[3] = 9`.

     **Inner Loop (`y = 4`):**

     - `winners[4] = 5`: No match.

  ------

  1. Outer Loop (`x = 4`):
     - No `y` values remain (`y = x + 1 = 5`).

  ------

  #### **Final Result:**

  - After all iterations, the `winners` array contains only unique numbers:

  ```C
  winners = [3, 7, 4, 9, 5];
  
  ```

### Avoiding repeated numbers, another approach

![Screenshot from 2024-11-29 21-37-42](/home/chan/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2024-11-29 21-37-42.png)

- An array `numbers[]` has been initialized with all zeros.
- The array's elements represent balls in a lottery.
- When an element has the value zero, it means that the ball hasn't yet been drawn.
- When a ball is drawn, its corresponding element in the array is set to 1, as shown in the above figure.
- For example, if the random number generator returns 12, the 12th element of the array is set to one.
- If the element is zero, the number is available and it's set to zero.
- If the element is 1, it's skipped and another random number is generated.

```C
for(x = 0; x < draw; x++){
    do{
        r = rand() % balls;
    }while(numbers[r] == 1);
    numbers[r] = 1;
}
```

- The `numbers[]` array represents the simulated lotto balls.
- The `do-while` loop repeats whenever the random array element `numbers[r]` is equal to 1. This test ensures that a ball isn't drawn twice.



```C
int main(){
    const int balls = 69, draw = 5;
    int x, r, count;
    int numbers[balls];
    
    srand((unsigned)time(NULL));
    
    printf("Drawing %d numbers from %d balls:\n", draw, balls);
    
    // Initialize the array
    for(x = 0; x < balls; x++){
        numbers[x] = 0;
    }
    
    // select the random values
    for(x = 0; x < draw; x++){
        do{
            r = rand() % balls;
        }while(numbers[r] == 1);
        numbers[r] = 1;
    }
    
    count = 0;
    
    // Process the array to cull the winning numbers
    for(x = 0; x < balls; x++){
        
        // If the element is nonzero (1), the ball was drawn.
        if(numbers[x]){
            // Outputs the ball number, plus one to account for the array starting at element 0
            printf(" %d", x + 1);
            count++;
            
            // After all but the last number, output a dash separator
            if(count < draw){
                printf(" -");
            }
        }
    }
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}
```

```shell

```



### Creating the `lotto()` function

- In the `lotto()` function shown next, the `numbers[]` array now dwells within the `lotto()` function because its contents need not be retained between calls.
- After the array is initialized, a `for` loop sets the random element values representing numbers drawn.
- This operation is followed by a second `for` loop that processes the entire `numbers[]` array, filling elements from the passed array.

```C
enum
{
    BALLS = 69,
    DRAW = 5
};

void lotto(int *a);
```



```C
// the arrya is referenced as a pointer
void lotto(int *a)
{
    int numbers[BALLS];
    int x, y, r;
	
    // Initialize the numbers[] array
    for (x = 0; x < BALLS; x++)
    {
        numbers[x] = 0;
    }

    // Randomly draws items in the array
    for (x = 0; x < DRAW; x++)
    {
        do
        {
            r = rand() % BALLS;
        } while (numbers[r] == 1);
        numbers[r] = 1;
    }

    // Variable y serves as an index into the passed array
    y = 0;
    
    // Fills the passed array's elements with the random numbers drawn
    for (x = 0; x < BALLS; x++)
    {
        // If the ball has been drawn...
        if (numbers[x])
        {
            // sets the element number in the passed array
            a[y] = x;
            y++;
        }
        
        // If the passed array is full, breaks the loop
        if (y == DRAW)
        {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

```C
int main()
{
    int x;
    
    // use an array as the argument for the looto function
    int match[DRAW];

    srand((unsigned)time(NULL));

    printf("Trying to match:");
    
    // call the lotto() function, filling array match
    lotto(match);
    
    // Outputs the array's elements, the lottery "winners"
    for (x = 0; x < DRAW; x++)
    {
        printf(" %d", match[x] + 1);
        if (x < DRAW - 1)
        {
            printf(" -");
        }
    }
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}
```



```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Trying to match: 12 - 16 - 28 - 35 - 50
```

- The output looks like all the other `lotto` programs so far, though with the `lotto()` function set, it's now possible to draw multiple lottery numbers in the same code.
- The next step is to obtain another set of random lottery ball picks to see whether they match the first numbers drawn.

### Matching lottery picks

- To make the comparison between two sets of lottery ball draws, the `winner()` function is used.
- As arguments, it consumes two arrays, referenced as integer pointers.
- Nested `for` loops compare each array value from the first array with each array value in the second array.
- Pointer notation is used to make the comparison.
- When a match is found, variable `c` is incremented.
- The total number of matches, ranging from zero through `DRAW` , is returned.

`practice.h`

```C
enum
{
    BALLS = 69,
    DRAW = 5
};

void lotto(int *a);

int winner(int *m, int *g);
```

`functions.c`

```C
// the array is referenced as a pointer
void lotto(int *a)
{
    int numbers[BALLS];
    int x, y, r;
	
    // Initialize the numbers[] array
    for (x = 0; x < BALLS; x++)
    {
        numbers[x] = 0;
    }

    // Randomly draws items in the array
    for (x = 0; x < DRAW; x++)
    {
        do
        {
            r = rand() % BALLS;
        } while (numbers[r] == 1);
        numbers[r] = 1;
    }

    // Variable y serves as an index into the passed array
    y = 0;
    
    // Fills the passed array's elements with the random numbers drawn
    for (x = 0; x < BALLS; x++)
    {
        // If the ball has been drawn...
        if (numbers[x])
        {
            // sets the element number in the passed array
            a[y] = x;
            y++;
        }
        
        // If the passed array is full, breaks the loop
        if (y == DRAW)
        {
            break;
        }
    }

        {
            // Compares each element value

                c++; // increment the variable if two values match

    printf("You matched %d numbers.\n", c);
    return 0;
}

      Your draw: 5 - 10 - 11 - 36 - 55

```

- If we remove `srand(time(NULL))`, 

```shell
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Trying to match: 7 - 26 - 30 - 35 - 47
      Your draw: 2 - 25 - 38 - 47 - 58

```



### Testing the odds

The next listing shows the `main()` function from an updated - the final - version of the `lotto` series of programs.

- The `lotto()` and `winner()` functions are unchanged, but to the `main()` function, a constant, `tomatch` is added which sets the minimum number of balls to match before a do-while loop stops drawing random lotto balls.
- Nothing is output until a match is found, which shaves several seconds from the processing time.
