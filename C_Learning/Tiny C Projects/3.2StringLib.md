### A string library

#### Creating a library

- Libraries are created from object code files.
- The `ar` (archive) utility is what transforms the object code file into a library.

```C
ar -rcs libmystring.a mystring.o
```

- -c - Creates the archive
- -s - Indexes the archive
- -r - Inserts file(s) into the archive

Name format that follows the convention used in Linux: `libname.a`.



**How I updated my MakeFile**

```makefile
# Compiler & Standard
CC = clang
STD = -std=c23

# Compiler Flags
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -g -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=700
LIBS = -lssl -lcrypto -lpthread -lm

# Directories
LIBDIR = ./libs
OBJDIR = ./obj

# Targets
all: final

# Final executable
final: $(OBJDIR)/main.o $(LIBDIR)/libhello.a
	@echo "Linking and producing the final application"
	$(CC) $(STD) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJDIR)/main.o -L$(LIBDIR) -lhello -o final $(LIBS)

# Object files
$(OBJDIR)/main.o: main.c hello.h
	@echo "Compiling the main file"
	$(CC) $(STD) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c -o $(OBJDIR)/main.o

$(OBJDIR)/hello.o: hello.c hello.h
	@echo "Compiling the hello file"
	$(CC) $(STD) $(CFLAGS) -c hello.c -o $(OBJDIR)/hello.o

#Static library
$(LIBDIR)/libhello.a: $(OBJDIR)/hello.o
	@echo "Creating static library libhello.a"
	ar -rcs $(LIBDIR)/libhello.a $(OBJDIR)/hello.o

# Clean up
clean:
	@echo "Removing everything except the source files"
	@rm -f ./*.o $(OBJDIR)/*.o $(LIBDIR)/libhello.a final
```

- If we have copied the library into the `/usr/local/lib` folder, the linker searches for it there.
- The `-L` (big L) switch directs the linker to look in a specific directory for library files.



### A Kinda OOP approach

- C is a procedural programming language. 
- Inelegantly put, this description means that C code runs from top to bottom, with one thing happening after another.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) involves methods instead of functions.
- Methods work like functions, though they are often a part of the data type they manipulate.

For example, in Java,

```Java
Len = Str.length()
```

- The string variable is named `Str`. 
- The dot operator access the `length()` method, which is attached to all string objects.
- The equivalent in C is

```C
len = strlen(str);
```

The dot operator is also used in C, specifically in a structure.

#### Adding a function to a structure

- A structure contains members of specific data types: int, float, char and so on.
- As it turns out, a function is also a data type, and it can serve as a member of a structure.

```C
type (*name) (arguments)
```

- The `type` is a data type, the value returned from the function or `void` for nothing returned.
- The `name` is the function's name, which is secretly a pointer. 
- In this format, the function's name isn't followed by parentheses.
- Instead, the `arguments` item lists any arguments passed to the function.

```C
struct str{
    char *string;
    unsigned long (*length) (const char *);
}
```

- The `str` structure's function member is referenced as the `length`.
  - It takes a `const char` pointer -  a string - as its argument and it returns an `unsigned long` value.
- To make the function member work, it must be assigned to a specific function.
- In this case, `strlen()` is ideal which takes a `const char` pointer as an argument and returns an `unsigned long` value.
- Creating a structure merely defines its members.
- To use the structure, a variable of the structure type is created.
- Here, structure `str` variable `str1` is created:

```C
struct str str1;
```

- And its members must be assigned values. Here is how the `length` member is assigned:

```C
str1.length = &strlen;
```

- The `length` member's function is `strlen()`.
- It is specified without the parentheses, prefixed by the ampersand to obtain its address.
- Once assigned, the function member can be called like any function.

```C
len = str1.length(str1.string);
```

- Member `str1.length` is a function (secretly `strlen()`).
- It operates on the `string` member of the same structure, `str1.string`.
- The value returned, the length of the string, is stored in variable `len`.



`main.c`

```C
int main(){
    struct str{
        char *string;
        unsigned long (*length) (const char *);
    };
    struct str str1;
    char s[] = "Heresy";
    
    // The string member is assigned
    str1.string = s;
    
    // The function is assigned, no parentheses, and prefixed by the address-of operator.
    str1.length = &strlen;
    
    printf("The string '%s' is %lu characters long\n", str1.string, str1.length(str1.string));
    return 0;
}
```

`Output`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
The string 'Heresy' is 6 characters long
```

#### Creating a string "object"

- To create a phony string object, a `string_create()` function is needed. 
- This function is passed a pointer to a `string` structure along with the string's contents (text).

```C
int string_create(struct string *s, char *v);
```

- The pointer is necessary to allow the function to modify the structure directly.
- Without the pointer, any changes made to the passed structure within the function are discarded.
- The string passed, `v`, is eventually incorporated into the structure along with other informative goodies.



`string_create()`

- Returns TRUE or FALSE values depending on whether the object is successfully created.
- The string's length is obtained and stored in the structure's length member. 
- This value is used to allocate storage for the string.

```C
int string_create(struct string*s, char *v){
    // Confirm that a string is available, if not, returns FALSE
    if(s == NULL){
        return FALSE;
    }
    
    s->length = strlen(v);
    
    s-> value = malloc(sizeof(char) * s->length + 1);
    if(s->value == NULL){
        return FALSE;
    }
    
    strcpy(s->value, v);
    
    return TRUE;
}
```



`string_destroy()`

- Just as an object is created, a companion `string_destroy()` function must exist.
- This function removes the object, which means de-allocating the string's storage and zeroing out any other structure members.
- The `string_destroy()` does three things:
  - frees the allocated memory
  - assigns the value pointer to NULL (which confirms that the memory is deallocated).
  - sets the string's length to zero.
- This function does not obliterate the structure variable, unlike OOP languages that may also remove the variable that's created.

```C
void string_destroy(struct string *s){
    free(s->value);
    s->value = NULL;
    s->length = 0;
}
```



Completed program

`hello.h`

```C
enum{
    TRUE,
    FALSE
};

struct string
{
    char *value;
    int length;
};

int string_create(struct string *s, char *v);

void string_destroy(struct string *s);
```

`hello.c`

```C
int string_create(struct string *s, char *v){
    if(s == NULL){
        return FALSE;
    }
    
    s->length = strlen(v);
    s->value = malloc(sizeof(char) * s->length + 1);
    
    if(s->value == NULL){
        return FALSE;
    }
    
    strcpy(s->value, v);
    
    return TRUE;
}

void string_destroy(struct string *s){
    
}
```

`main.c`

```C
int main(){
    struct string str1;
    string_create(&str1, "I am not a string object");
    
    printf("The string '%s' is %d characters long\n", str1.value, str1.length);
    
    string_destroy(&str1);
    return 0;
}
```

`Output`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
The string 'I am not a string object' is 24 characters long
```

- After destroying a string structure variable, it can be reused or reassigned.
- The point it to have both a create function and a destroy function for the "object" which mimics how some object-oriented programming languages work with objects.
