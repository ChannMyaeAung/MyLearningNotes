## Theories from HFC Book 



#### Chapter 2 - Memory and pointers



**Pointer** - A pointer is just the address of a piece of data in memory.

- Pointers help you do both these things: avoid copies and share data.



Every time you declare a variable, the computer creates space for it somewhere in memory. If you declare a variable inside a function like main(), the computer will store it in a section of memory called the **stack**. If a variable is declared outside any function, it will be stored in the **globals** section of memory.



- **&** to find out the memory address of the variable.

  ```C
  printf("x is stored at %p\n", &x);
  
  // x is stored at 0x7ffdd281e4b4
  
  ```

  

- The address of the variable tells you where to find the variable in memory. That's why an address is also called a **pointer** because it **points** to the variable in memory.
