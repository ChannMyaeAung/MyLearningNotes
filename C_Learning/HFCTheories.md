## Theories from HFC Book 



#### Chapter 2 - Memory and pointers



**Pointer** - A pointer is just the address of a piece of data in memory.

- Pointers help you do both these things: avoid copies and share data.



Every time you declare a variable, the computer creates space for it somewhere in memory. If you declare a variable inside a function like main(), the computer will store it in a section of memory called the **stack**. If a variable is declared outside any function, it will be stored in the **globals** section of memory.



- **&** to find out the memory address of the variable.

  ```C
  printf("x is stored at %p\n", &x);
  
  // x is stored at 0x7ffdd281e4b4
  
  ```

  

- The address of the variable tells you where to find the variable in memory. That's why an address is also called a **pointer** because it **points** to the variable in memory.



Q: Why are local variables stored in the stack and globals stored somewhere else?

A: Local and global variables are used differently. You will only ever get one copy of a global variable, but if you write a function that calls itself, you might get very many instances of the same local variable.



- Pointers make it easier to share memory, to let functions share memory. The data created by one function can be modified by another function, so long as it knows where to find it in memory.



Three things you need to know in order to use pointers to read and write data.

1. Get the address of a variable.

   - A pointer variable is just a variable that stores a memory address. When declaring a pointer variable, you need to say what kind of data is stored at the address it will point to:

     ```C
     int x = 4;
     int *address_of_x = &x;
     ```

     

2. Read the contents of an address.

   - When you have  a memory address, you will want to read the data that's stored there with * operator:

     ```C
     int value_stored = *address_of_x;
     // This will read the contents at the memory address given by address_of_x. This will be set to 4: the value originally stored in the x variable.
     ```

   - Notes: **The & operator takes a piece of data and tells you where it's stored while the * operator takes an address and tells you what's stored there.**

   - Because pointers are sometimes called references, the * operator is said to dereference a pointer. (dereferencing in details below)

3. Change the contents of an address.

   - If you have a pointer variable and want to change the data at the address where the variable's pointing, you can just use * operator again but on the **left side** of an assignment:

     ```C
     *address_of_x = 99;
     ```

     



Summary Bullet Points

- Variables are allocated storage in memory.
- Local variables live in the stack.
- Global variables live in the globals section.
- Pointers are just variables that store memory addresses.
- The & operator finds the address of a variable.
- The * operator can read the contents of a memory address.
- The * operator can also set the contents of a memory address.
- An array variable can be used as a pointer. 
- The array variable points to the first element in the array.
- If you declare an array argument to a function, it will be treated as a pointer.
- The **sizeof** operator returns the space taken by a piece of data. It returns the size of the pointer, which is typically 4 or 8 bytes depending on the system's architecture, not the size of the original array.
- You can also call **sizeof** for a data type such as **sizeof(int)**.
- **sizeof(a pointer)** returns 4 on 32-bit OS and 8 on 64-bit. On 32-bit OS, a memory address is stored as a 32-bit number. That's why it's called a 32-bit system. 32 bits == 4 bytes. That's why a 64-bit system uses 8 bytes to store an address.
- **sizeof** is not a function but it's an operator.
- An operator is compiled to a sequence of instructions by the compiler. But if the code calls a function, it has to jump to a separate piece of code.
- If I create a pointer variable, does the pointer variable live in memory? Yes. A pointer variable is just a variable storing a number. You can find the address of a pointer variable using the & operator.



#### Dereferencing (In Details)

In C programming, dereferencing is the process of accessing the value that a pointer is pointing to. A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable, and dereferencing is the way to retrieve or modify the value stored at that address.

The dereference operator in C is the asterisk (`*`). When you have a pointer variable, you can use the dereference operator to access the value it points to.

Here's an example to illustrate dereferencing:

```
cCopy code#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10;  // Declare and initialize an integer variable
    int *ptr;    // Declare a pointer variable

    ptr = &x;    // Store the address of x in the pointer variable ptr

    printf("Value of x: %d\n", x);            // Output: Value of x: 10
    printf("Value stored at address %p: %d\n", ptr, *ptr);  // Output: Value stored at address 0x7ffeebfc4b9c: 10

    *ptr = 20;   // Dereference ptr to modify the value it points to

    printf("Value of x: %d\n", x);            // Output: Value of x: 20

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

1. We declare an integer variable `x` and initialize it with the value `10`.
2. We declare a pointer variable `ptr` of type `int*`, which means it will store the address of an integer variable.
3. We store the address of `x` in the pointer variable `ptr` using the address-of operator `&`.
4. We print the value of `x` and the value stored at the address contained in `ptr` using the dereference operator `*ptr`.
5. We use the dereference operator `*ptr` on the left-hand side of an assignment to modify the value that `ptr` is pointing to, changing the value of `x` to `20`.
6. We print the new value of `x` to confirm that it has been modified.

Dereferencing is a fundamental concept in C programming, as it allows you to manipulate the values stored in memory locations using pointers. It's essential to understand dereferencing to work with dynamic memory allocation, data structures like linked lists, and other advanced programming concepts in C.

However, it's important to be careful when dereferencing pointers, as dereferencing an invalid or uninitialized pointer can lead to undefined behavior and potential program crashes.

#### Arrays

An array variable can be used as a pointer to the first element in an array. That means you can read the first element of the array either by using the brackets notation or using the * operator like this

The index is just the number that's added to the pointer to find the location of the element.



```C
int drinks[] = {4,2,3};
printf("1st order: %i drinks\n", drinks[0]);
printf("1st order: %i drinks\n", *drinks);
// The above two lines of code are equivalent.
// drinks[0] == *drinks

printf("3rd order: %i drinks\n", drinks[2]);
printf("3rd order: %i drinks\n", *(drinks + 2));
```



#### Why pointers have types

Pointer types exist so that the compiler knows how much to adjust the pointer arithmetic.

For instance, if you add 1 to a char pointer, the pointer will point to the very next memory address because a char occupies 1 byte of memory.



**int** usually takes 4 bytes of space, so if you add 1 to an int pointer, the complied code will actually add 4 to the memory address.

```C
int nums[] = {1,2,3};
printf("nums is at %p\n", nums);
printf("nums + 1 is at %p\n", nums + 1);

// nums is at 0x7ffdca81cabc
// nums + 1 is at 0x7ffdca81cac0

// nums + 1 is 4 bytes away from nums.
// these addresses are printed in hex format.

int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
printf("result: %p %p %p\n", arr, arr + 1, arr + 2);

// result: 0x7fff82772940 0x7fff82772944 0x7fff82772948
// 4 bytes away from each other.
```



##### Bullet Points

- Array variables can be used as pointers
- but array variables are not quite the same
- Array variables are not pointers themselves. They are just a special type of variable that can be used as pointers in certain contexts thanks to the implicit conversion provided by the C language.
- Array variables have a fixed size and cannot be reassigned to point to a different memory location unlike pointers.
- *sizeof* is different for array and pointer variables.
- Array variables can't point to anything else.
- Passing an array variable to a pointer decays it.
- You can pass array variables as arguments to functions that expect pointers. The array variable decays into a pointer to its first element when passed to the function and the function has no way to determine the size of the original array.
- Arrays start at zero because of pointer arithmetic.
- You can perform pointer arithmetic on array variables just like you would with regular pointers. For example, `arr+1` points to the second element of the array `arr`.
- You can dereference an array variable using * operator, which accesses the value at the memory address it points to. For example, `*arr` gives you the value of the first element of the array.
- Pointer variables have types so they can adjust pointer arithmetic.



#### scanf()

scanf() can cause buffer overflows if you forget to limit the length of the string that you read with scanf(), then any user can enter far more data than the program has space to store. The extra data then gets written into memory that has not been properly allocated by the computer.



```C
char first_name[20];
    char last_name[20];

    printf("Enter your first and last name: \n");
    scanf("%19s %19s", first_name, last_name);

    printf("First: %s Last: %s\n", first_name, last_name);

// scanf() uses the same kind of format strings as printf() but when we print a string with printf(), we just use %s. Well, if you just use %s in scanf(), there can be a problem if someone gets a little type-happy:

char food[5];
printf("Enter favorite food: ");
scanf("%s", food);
printf("Favorite food: %s\n", food);

// Enter favorite food: liver-tangeraine-raccoon-toffee
// Favorite food: liver-tangeraine-raccoon-toffee
// *** stack smashing detected ***: terminated
// Aborted (core dumped)

```



Stack smashing detected is a security alert that occurs when a program tries to write data beyond the boundary of a buffer allocated on the stack memory. This can potentially lead to memory corruption and security vulnerabilities.

In the code you provided, the issue occurs due to the scanf statement:

The %s format specifier in scanf reads a string from the input until it encounters a whitespace character (space, newline, tab, etc.). The problem is that scanf doesn't check the length of the input string and writes it directly into the food array, which has a fixed size of 5 characters.

When you enter the string "liver-tangeraine-raccoon-toffee", which is longer than 5 characters, scanf writes the entire string into the food array, overwriting memory beyond the boundaries of the food array. This memory area could be used for other variables, function call information, or other important data stored on the stack.

Overwriting this memory is what causes the "stack smashing" error. The stack is a critical region of memory used for storing function call information, local variables, and other data. When data is written beyond the boundaries of the stack, it can corrupt this information, leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or even potential security vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the input data.

To fix this issue, you need to use a safer string input function that limits the number of characters read or use a dynamically allocated buffer with a sufficient size. For example, you can use the fgets function to read a line of input with a maximum length:

```C
#include <string.h>

int main(void){
    char food[100];
    printf("Enter favorite food: ");
    if(fgets(food, sizeof(food), stdin) != NULL){
        food[strcspn(food, "\n")] = "\0";
        printf("Favorite food: %s\n", food);
    }
    return 0;
}
```



In this example, fgets reads a line of input up to a maximum of sizeof(food) - 1 characters (accounting for the null terminator). The strcspn function is used to remove the newline character from the input string.

Stack smashing is a serious issue that can lead to security vulnerabilities, crashes, and data corruption. It's important to always validate input data and use safe functions or techniques to prevent buffer overflows and stack smashing errors.



#### fgets() is an alternative to scanf()

Unlike the scanf() function, the `fgets()` function must be given a maximum length:

```C
char food[5];
printf("Enter favorite food: ");
fgets(food, sizeof(food), stdin);

// First it takes a pointer to a buffer
// Next it takes a maximum size of the string ("\0 included")
// stdin just means the data will be coming from the keyboard.
```

- fgets() buffer size includes the final `\0` character. So we don't need to subtract 1 from the length as you do with scanf().

- `sizeof` returns the amount of space occupied by a variable.

- If `food` was a simple pointer, you'd give an explicit length, rather than using `sizeof`.

  ```C
  printf("Enter favorite food: ");
  fgets(food, 5, stdin);
  ```

  



|                                                              | scanf()                                                      | fgets()                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Do you limit the number of characters that a user can enter? | scanf() can limit the data entered, so long as you remember to add the size to the format string. | fgets() has a mandatory limit. Nothing gets past him.        |
| Can you be used to enter more than one field?                | Yes! scanf() will not only allow you to enter more than one field, but it also allows you to enter structured data including the ability to specify what characters appear between fields. | fgets() allows you to enter just one string into a buffer. No other data types. Just strings. Just one buffer. |
| If someone enters a string, can it contain spaces?           | When scanf() reads a string with the %s, it stops as soon as it hits a space. So if you want to enter more than one word, you either have to call it more than once, or use some fancy regular expression trick. | No problem with spaces at all. fgets() can read the whole string every time. |

- Clearly if you need to enter structured data with several fields, you'll want to use scanf(). If you are entering a single unstructured string, then fgets() is probably the way to go.



#### Three-card monte

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    char *cards = "JQK";
    char a_card = cards[2];
    cards[2] = cards[1];
    cards[1] = cards[0];
    cards[0] = cards[2];
    cards[2] = cards[1];
    cards[1] = a_card;
    puts(cards);
    return 0;
}
```



The above code will result in an error because the string literals can never be updated.

A variable that points to a string literal can't be used to change the contents of the string:

```C
char *cards = "JQK"; // This variable can't modify this string
```

But if you create an array from a string literal, then you can modify it:

```C
char cards[] = "JQK";
```



**Note to myself:** Refer to page 113 in Head First C book for visualization.

1. The computer loads the string literal.
   - when the computer loads the program into memory, it puts all of the constant values into the constant memory block. This section of memory is read-only.
2. The program creates the cards variable on the stack.
3. The cards variable is set to the address of "JQK".
   - The cards variable will contain the address of the string literal "JQK".
4. The computer  tries to change the string.
   - It cannot change because it's read-only.



#### If you're going to change a string, make a copy

If you create a copy of the string in an area of memory that's not read-only, there won't be a problem if you try to change the letters it contains.

We can make a copy just by creating the string as a new array.

```C
char cards[] = "JQK";
// cards is not just a pointer. cards is now an array.
```

In the old code, cards was just a pointer. In the new code, it's an array. By declaring an array called cards and then set it to a string literal, the cards array will be a completely new copy. The variable isn't just pointing at the string literal. It's a brand-new array that contains a fresh copy of the string literal.



```C
int my_function{
    char cards[] = "JQK";
    // cards is an array
    // There is no array size given, so you have to set it to something immediately.
}

// The following two functions are equivalent.
void stack_deck(char cards[]){
    ...
}

void stack_deck(char *cards){
    ...
}

```



With our new code `char cards[] = "JQK"`,

1. The computer loads the string literal.
2. The program creates a new array on the stack.
3. The program initializes the array.
   - As well as allocating the space, the program will also copy the contents of the string literal "JQK" into the stack memory.



**Difference:** the original code used a pointer to point to a read-only string literal. But if you initialize an array with a string literal, you then have a copy of the letters and you can change them as much as you like.



```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
    char cards[] = "JQK";
    char a_card = cards[2];
    cards[2] = cards[1];
    cards[1] = cards[0];
    cards[0] = cards[2];
    cards[2] = cards[1];
    cards[1] = a_card;
    puts(cards);

    return 0;
}

// Output: QKJ
```



The `cards` variable now points to a string in an unprotected section of memory, so we are free to modify its contents.



**Tips: **

One way to avoid this problem in the future is to never write code that sets a simple char pointer to a string literal value like:

```C
char *s = "Some string";
```



There's nothing wrong with setting a pointer to a string literal - the problems only happen when you try to modify a string literal. Instead, if you want to set a pointer to a literal, always make sure you use the `const` keyword.

```C
const char *s = "some string";
```



That way if the compiler sees some code that tries to modify the string, it will give you a compile error:

```C
s[0] = 'S'; 
```



**Note to myself:** Refer to page 115 on HFC book to see the five-minute mystery case emphasizing memory and pointers.



##### Bullet points

- if you see * in a variable declaration, it means the variable will be a pointer.
- String literals are stored in read-only memory.
- Why are string literals stored in read-only memory? Because they are designed to be constant. If you write a function to print "Hello World", you don't want some other part of the program modifying the "Hello World" string literal.
- If you want to modify a string, you need to make a copy in a new array.
- You can declare a `char` pointer as `const char *` to prevent the code from using it to modify a string. The `const` modifier means that the compiler will complain if you try to modify an array with that particular variable.
- When the program is complied, all the references to array variables are replaced with the addresses of the array. So the truth is that the array variable won't exist in the final executable. That's OK because the array variable will never be needed to point anywhere else.
- `scanf()` means "scan formatted" because it's used to scan formatted input.



#### Memory memorizer

**Stack:** A section of memory used for local variable storage. Every time you call a function, all of the function's local variables get created on the stack. It's called the stack because it's like a stack of plates: variables get added to the stack when you enter a function, and get taken off the stack when you leave. The stack actually works upside down, it starts at the top of memory and grows downward.



**Heap:** The heap is for dynamic memory: pieces of data that get created when the program is running and then hang around a long time.



**Globals:** A global variable is a variable that lives outside all of the functions and is visible to all of them. Globals get created when the program first runs and you can update them freely. But that's unlike...



**Constants:** Created when the program first runs and they are stored in read-only memory. E.g things like string literals that you'll need when the program is running but you'll never want them to change.



**Code:** Finally the code segment. A lot of OS place the code right down in the lowest memory addresses. The code segment is also read-only. The is the part of the memory where the actual assembled code gets loaded.



**Refer to page 121 for visualization**.



**Summary of Chapter 2 Theories:**

- `scanf("%i", &x)` will allow a user  to enter a number x directly.
- ints are different sizes on different machines.
- A char pointer variable x is declared as `char *x`.
- String literals are stored in read-only memory.
- Initialize a new array with a string and it will copy it.
- Read the contents of an address a with `*a`.
- `fgets(buf, size, stdin)` is a simpler way to enter text.
- Local variables are stored on the stack.
- `&x` returns the address of x.
- `&x` is called a pointer to x.

### Chapter 2.5

Q: Why do I have to put the find_track () function before main()?

A: C needs to know what parameters a function takes and what its return type is before it can be called.



- You can create an array of arrays with `char strings[...][...]`.
- The first set of brackets is used to access the outer arrray.
- The second set of brackets is used to access the details of each of the inner arrays.
- The `string.h` header file gives you access to a set of string manipulation functions in the C Standard Library.
- You can create several functions in C program but the computer will always run `main()` first.



#### Array of arrays vs array of pointers

An array of arrays is used to stored a sequence of strings.

An array of pointers is actually a list of memory addresses stored in an array. It's very useful if you want to quickly create a list of string literals.

```C
char *names_for_dog[] = {"Browser", "Bonza", "Snodgrass"};
// This is an array that stores pointers.
// There will be one pointer pointing at each string literal.
```



You can access the array of pointers just like you accessed the array of arrays.

### Chapter 3

##### Small tools can solve big problems

A small tool does one task and does it well. OS like Linux are mostly made up of hundreds and hundreds of small tools.

If one small part of your program needs to convert data from one format to another, that's the perfect kind of task for a small tool.

- `scanf()` always uses pointers.
