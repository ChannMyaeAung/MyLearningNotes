## C Programming Essentials

- C is a language behind the Internet and almost every operating system
- C is a language that's used to write almost all the other languages.
- C is a language that can write for almost every processor in existence, from watches and phones to places and satellites.

When we run `make` or when we run `clang`, four different things are happening under the hood.

- preprocessing
- compiling
- assembling
- linking

Speaking of compiling, some of the most widely used and modern C compilers include:

1. **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**:
   - Highly portable and widely used.
   - Supports various standards including C99, C11, and C18.
   - Available on most Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS.
2. **Clang**:
   - Part of the LLVM project.
   - Known for its fast compilation times and excellent diagnostics.
   - Supports modern C standards and is highly portable.
   - Often used as the default compiler on macOS.
3. **MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)**:
   - The primary compiler for Windows development.
   - Integrated with Visual Studio.
   - Supports modern C standards and provides excellent integration with Windows-specific features.

In C, the conventions for return values are as follows:

- `return 0;` typically means success or no error. This is the standard way to indicate that a program or function executed successfully.
- `return 1;` is often used to indicate a general error condition. It's a common convention to return 1 when an error occurs, but the specifics of the error are not differentiated.
- `return 2;`, `return 3;`, and so on, are sometimes used to represent different types of errors or failure conditions. However, there is no universal standard for what each non-zero return value means - it depends on the specific program or library.

Many programs and libraries define their own error codes, with different non-zero values representing different types of errors. For example, a library might return 2 for a file not found error, 3 for an invalid argument error, and so on.

It's important to note that these conventions are not enforced by the C language itself. They are simply common practices that programmers follow to indicate success or failure in their programs. The specific meaning of non-zero return values is up to the programmer or the library/API being used.

In general, if you see a non-zero return value from a C program or function, you should consult the documentation or source code to determine what that specific value means in that context.

### Memory Layout in C

![C Board](https://cboard.cprogramming.com/attachments/c-programming/16282d1610305071-memory-layout-c-program-goes-into-ram-selection_006-png)

Memory segmentation in C refers to the division of a program's memory into distinct sections, each serving a specific purpose. This is typically done by the operating system and the compiler to manage memory more efficiently. The common segments in C are:

#### 1. **Text (Code) Segment**

- **Purpose**: This segment contains the executable instructions (machine code) of the program, i.e., the compiled code that will be executed by the CPU.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Typically **read-only** to prevent accidental modification of instructions.
  - Shared among processes that execute the same program (to save memory).

Example:

```C
int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");  // The code for this function is in the text segment.
    return 0;
}
```

#### 2. **Data Segment**

- **Purpose**: This segment stores **global** and **static** variables that are initialized with some value at the start of the program.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Divided into two parts:
    - **Initialized Data Segment**: Stores global and static variables that are initialized.
    - **Uninitialized Data Segment (BSS)**: Stores global and static variables that are declared but not initialized. These variables are initialized to zero by default.

Example:

```C
int globalVar = 10;     // Stored in the initialized data segment.
static int staticVar;   // Stored in the BSS segment (zero-initialized by default).
```

#### 3. **Heap Segment**

- **Purpose**: The heap is used for **dynamically allocated memory** at runtime. Memory on the heap is allocated using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, and `realloc` and needs to be manually freed using `free`.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Grows upward in memory (from lower to higher addresses).
  - Must be managed explicitly by the programmer to avoid memory leaks.

Example:

```C
int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));  // Memory allocated on the heap.
*ptr = 20;
free(ptr);  // Must free heap memory to avoid memory leaks.
```

#### 4. **Stack Segment**

- **Purpose**: The stack is used for **local variables** and **function call management** (such as function parameters, return addresses, and local variables).
- **Characteristics:**
  - Grows downward in memory (from higher to lower addresses).
  - Automatically managed (i.e., memory is automatically allocated and deallocated when a function is called and returns).
  - Limited in size, and excessive use of stack memory (e.g., through deep recursion) can lead to a **stack overflow**.

Example:

```C
void foo() {
    int localVar = 5;  // Stored on the stack.
}
```

### Diagram of Memory Segmentation:

```
High Memory Addresses
---------------------
|      Stack        | <---- Grows downward
---------------------
|       Heap        | <---- Grows upward
---------------------
| Uninitialized Data| (BSS segment)
---------------------
| Initialized Data  |
---------------------
|      Text         |
---------------------
Low Memory Addresses
```

#### Summary of Memory Segments:

- **Text Segment**: Contains executable code, usually read-only.
- **Data Segment:** Contains global and static variables.
  - **Initialized Data**: Stores variables with initial values.
  - **BSS**: Stores uninitialized global and static variables.
- **Heap**: Used for dynamic memory allocation at runtime, managed manually.
- **Stack**: Holds local variables, function parameters, and manages function calls, automatically managed by the system.

Understanding these segments helps in managing memory efficiently, preventing issues like memory leaks, and avoiding stack overflows.

### Should declare a normal variable or a pointer variable?

In C, whether you should declare a **normal variable** or a **pointer variable** depends on the use case and how you need to manage and access memory. Below are some guidelines to help you decide:

#### Use a **Normal Variable** when:

1. **You want to store a direct value**: If you want to store a specific value (such as an integer, float, char, etc.) and you don't need to manipulate memory addresses, a normal variable is sufficient.

   Example:

   ```C
   int x = 10;    // Normal variable holding an integer value directly.
   char ch = 'A'; // Normal variable holding a character.
   ```

2. **You don't need dynamic memory allocation**: If the variable's size is known at compile time (e.g., an integer, an array with a fixed size), you can declare a normal variable.

   Example:

   ```C
   int arr[10];  // Array with fixed size of 10 elements, allocated on the stack.
   ```

3. **You want automatic memory management**: Normal variables are typically allocated on the stack, and their memory is automatically freed when the function returns or when they go out of scope. This makes them easier to manage, as you don't need to worry about freeing memory.

#### Use a **Pointer Variable** when:

1. **You need to work with dynamic memory allocation**: If you need to allocate memory dynamically (at runtime), you must use pointers. Dynamic memory is allocated on the heap, and pointers are used to access and manage it.

   Example:

   ```C
   int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)); // Dynamically allocated memory on the heap.
   *ptr = 20;  // Dereference pointer to assign a value.
   free(ptr);  // Manually free the allocated memory.
   ```

2. **You want to pass large data efficiently**: If you need to pass large data structures (e.g., arrays, structs) to functions, it is often more efficient to pass a pointer to the data rather than passing the entire structure (which involves copying all the data).

   Example:

   ```C
   void modifyArray(int *arr, int size) {
       for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
           arr[i] = i;  // Modify the array using a pointer.
       }
   }
   
   int main() {
       int myArray[10];
       modifyArray(myArray, 10);  // Passing the array as a pointer.
   }
   ```

3. **You need to share a variable across multiple functions**: If you want to allow multiple functions to modify the same variable, you should pass a pointer to the variable, allowing the function to modify the value stored at that memory address.

   Example:

   ```C
   void modifyValue(int *p) {
       *p = 100;  // Modify the value pointed to by p.
   }
   
   int main() {
       int x = 10;
       modifyValue(&x);  // Pass the address of x.
       printf("%d\n", x);  // Output will be 100, since modifyValue modified x.
   }
   ```

4. **You need to manipulate arrays or strings**: Since arrays and strings in C are essentially pointers to memory locations, pointers are required to traverse and manipulate them efficiently.

   Example:

   ```C
   char str[] = "Hello, world!";
   char *p = str;  // Pointer to the first element of the string.
   while (*p != '\0') {
       printf("%c", *p);  // Print each character.
       p++;
   }
   ```

5. **You need to work with linked data structures**: Pointers are essential for creating and managing data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs, where each node or element contains a reference to another node (via a pointer).

   Example (Linked List Node):

   ```C
   struct Node {
       int data;
       struct Node *next;  // Pointer to the next node in the list.
   };
   ```

#### Key Differences Between Normal and Pointer Variables:

- Normal Variable

  : Stores the actual value directly.

  - Example: `int x = 10;` means `x` holds the value `10`.

- Pointer Variable

  : Stores the 

  memory address

   of another variable, allowing you to indirectly access or modify that variable's value.

  - Example: `int *p = &x;` means `p` holds the address of `x`, and `*p` (dereferencing) gives you access to the value of `x`.

#### When to Prefer Pointers:

- When dealing with large data structures that are expensive to copy.
- When you need dynamic memory allocation.
- When you need to share or modify data across different parts of the program.

#### When to Prefer Normal Variables:

- When you want simple, local values that don't need complex memory management.
- When the data is small and passing it by value is more efficient.

#### Example Code Illustrating Both:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void modifyWithPointer(int *p) {
    *p = 50;  // Modify the value at the memory location p points to.
}

void modifyWithNormal(int x) {
    x = 50;  // This modifies a copy, not the original variable.
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));  // Dynamically allocate memory.
    
    *ptr = 20;  // Dereference to assign a value to the allocated memory.
    
    printf("Before: a = %d\n", a);  // Outputs 10.
    modifyWithNormal(a);
    printf("After modifyWithNormal: a = %d\n", a);  // Still outputs 10.
    
    modifyWithPointer(&a);
    printf("After modifyWithPointer: a = %d\n", a);  // Outputs 50.

    free(ptr);  // Always free dynamically allocated memory.
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- `modifyWithNormal` changes a **copy** of the variable, so the original remains unchanged.
- `modifyWithPointer` works with a **pointer** and modifies the original variable by changing the value at its memory address.

### `POSIX`

In C programming, POSIX stands for "Portable Operating System Interface for Unix". It refers to a family of standards specified by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) that define the API (Application Programming Interface) for software compatible with Unix and Unix-like operating systems. These standards aim to ensure compatibility between different Unix systems, allowing software written for POSIX to be easily portable across various Unix platforms.

### `(*pointer)` vs `(pointer *)`

There is a significant difference between `(*pointer)` and `(pointer*)` in C. They are used in different contexts and serve different purposes.

### `(*pointer)`

`(*pointer)` is used to dereference a pointer. Dereferencing a pointer means accessing the value that the pointer is pointing to. Here, `pointer` is a variable that holds the address of another variable. The `*` operator, when placed before the `pointer`, accesses the value at the address stored in `pointer`.

Example:

```C
int value = 10;
int *pointer = &value; // pointer holds the address of value
printf("%d\n", *pointer); // prints 10, the value stored at the address
```

### `(pointer*)`

`(pointer*)` is a type cast operation in C. It is used to cast one type of pointer to another type. This is typically done to interpret the data in a different way.

Example:

```C
void *void_pointer;
int value = 10;
void_pointer = &value; // void_pointer now holds the address of value

int *int_pointer = (int*)void_pointer; // casting void_pointer to int*
printf("%d\n", *int_pointer); // prints 10, the value stored at the address
```

### Key Differences

1. **Dereferencing (`*pointer`)**:
   - Accesses the value stored at the address pointed to by `pointer`.
   - Used to get or set the value of the variable that `pointer` is pointing to.
2. **Type Casting (`(pointer*)`)**:
   - Changes the type of a pointer.
   - Used to interpret the pointed-to data in a different type.

### Examples to Illustrate the Difference

**Dereferencing Example**:

```C
int value = 42;
int *pointer = &value; // pointer holds the address of value
printf("Value: %d\n", *pointer); // Dereferencing pointer to print value: 42
```

**Type Casting Example**:

```C
void *void_pointer;
int value = 42;
void_pointer = &value; // void_pointer now holds the address of value

// Casting void_pointer to int* and then dereferencing to get the value
printf("Value: %d\n", *(int*)void_pointer); // Type casting and then dereferencing: 42
```

In summary, `(*pointer)` is for dereferencing to access the value stored at the pointer's address, whereas `(pointer*)` is for type casting a pointer to a different pointer type.

#### while(1)

The `while(1)` loop in C is an infinite loop. It continuously executes the block of code inside the loop without stopping, because the condition `1` (which represents a non-zero value, and thus `true` in C) never changes. To exit from such a loop, you typically need to use a break statement, return statement, or any other form of interrupt (like a signal handler in the case of a Unix-like system) that can alter the flow of control out of the loop.

- `while (true)` and `while (1)` are functionally equivalent in C. Both create an infinite loop that will continue to execute until a `break` statement or some other form of loop termination is encountered.
- **`while (true)`**: This is more readable and explicitly indicates that the loop is intended to run indefinitely. However, `true` is not a keyword in C; it is typically defined as `#define true 1` in `stdbool.h`.
- **`while (1)`**: This is a common idiom in C for creating an infinite loop. It is concise and directly uses the integer value `1`, which is always true in a `boolean` context.
- **Readability**: `while (true)` is generally more readable and self-explanatory.
- **Compatibility**: `while (1)` is universally understood and does not require including `stdbool.h`.

```C
while(1){
    printf("This will print indefinitely.\n");
}
```

```C
int count = 0;
while(1){
    printf("Count: %d\n", count);
    count++;
    if(count == 10){
        break; //Exit the loop when the count reaches 10
    }
}
printf("Exited the loop.\n");
```

Both are valid and commonly used in C programming. The choice between them often comes down to personal or team preference.

### Conditional Statements

- **In conditional statements**, `1` (or any non-zero value) typically means **true**, and `0` means **false**.
- This is why `if (!pid)` checks if `pid` is `0` (false), meaning the code inside this block runs in the child process, because `fork()` returns `0` in the child process.

### Return Values in `main` Function

- **In the `main` function**, returning `0` means **success**.
- Returning a **non-zero value** indicates an **error** or some other special condition.

### Example Breakdown

#### Conditional Statement:

```C
if (!pid)
{
    // This block runs in the child process
}
```

- Here, `!pid` evaluates to true if `pid` is `0` (which is the case in the child process after a successful `fork()`).

#### `main` Function Return:

```C
int main()
{
    // code
    return 0;  // Indicates success
}
```

- Returning `0` from the `main` function indicates that the program executed successfully.
- Returning a non-zero value indicates an error or abnormal termination. For example:

```C
int main()
{
    // code
    return 1;  // Indicates an error
}
```

### Summary

- **Conditional Statements**: `1` (or any non-zero value) means true; `0` means false.
- **`main` Function Return**: `0` means success; non-zero means error.

These conventions are widely used in C and many other programming languages.

#### C Concepts

- An array in C is essentially a constant pointer to its first element, we can represent an array of strings as an array of character pointers.

- Strings in C are compared using the `strcmp` function from the `<string.h>` library because strings are arrays of characters, and the `==` operator compares the addresses of the arrays rather than their contents.

- String comparison is based on the lexicographical order which is determined by the Unicode values (or ASCII values for simplicity) of the characters in the strings. 

- Lexicographical order compares strings character by character from left to right. If the characters are different, the comparison stops and the result is based on the difference between these characters. If they are the same, the comparison moves to the next character.

- Example: "apple" vs "banana". First characters: 'a' (Unicode: 97) and 'b' (Unicode: 98). Since 97 ('a') is less than 98 ('b'), "apple" is considered less than "banana". No further comparison is needed because the first character comparison already determined the result.

- ```C
  // Character Array
  char str1[] = "apple";
  
  // Pointer to a String Literal
  char *str2 = "apple";
  
  // Array of String Literals
  char *str3[] = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"};
  ```

- `char str1[] = "apple"` : We can modify `str1` (e.g., `str1[0] = 'A';`). Allocates memory on the stack and copies the string into it.

- `char *str1 = "apple"`: Modifying the string literal via `str1` (e.g., `str1[0] = 'A';`) leads to undefined behavior because string literals are stored in read-only memory. The pointer points to a fixed location in memory where the string literal is stored.

- What does `i->name` equivalent in pointer notation? `i->name` is equivalent to `(i*).name`. This notation dereferences the pointer `i` to access the `name` member of the structure(`struct`) it points to.

- In C, `void (*handler)(int)` is a declaration of a pointer to a function that takes an integer as its argument and returns nothing (`void`). This syntax is used for defining function pointers, which are variables that can store the address of a function. In this context, `handler` is a function pointer that is expected to point to a function designed to handle signals, with the signal number being passed as the integer argument.

  Here's a breakdown of the syntax:

  - `void` indicates the return type of the function that `handler`can point to, meaning the function does not return a value.
  - `(*handler)` is the function pointer itself. The parentheses around `*handler` are necessary to indicate that `handler` is a pointer to a function, not a function returning a pointer.
  - `(int)` specifies the type of argument that the function pointed to by `handler` takes, which is a single integer.

  Function pointers like `handler` are commonly used in C for callback functions, where you pass the address of a function into another function to be called later. 


#### Escaping Sequence

\n - newline

\t - tab

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
    printf("hello\n");
    printf("1\t2\t3\t");
    printf("\"I like Pizza\" - Abraham Lincoln probably\n"); // "I like Pizza" - Abraham Lincoln probably
}
```

\r - carriage return character

In C, `\r` is an escape sequence that represents the carriage return character. When output to a terminal or console, the carriage return (`\r`) moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line without advancing to the next line. This can be used to overwrite the contents of the current line in the terminal.

For example, if you print `"Hello, World!\rGoodbye!"`, the output will end up being `"Goodbye! World!"` because the cursor returns to the beginning of the line after `"Hello, World!"` is printed, and `"Goodbye!"` starts overwriting `"Hello, World!"` from the beginning of the line.

---



#### Variable

Allocated space in memory to store a value. We need to declare what type of data we are storing.

%s = string, %d = decimal, %i = integer

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
    int x;
    x = 123;
    int y = 321;
    int age = 21;
    float gpa = 2.05; // floating point number
    char grade = 'C'; // Single character
    char name[] = "Bro"; //array of characters
    
    printf("Hello %s\n", name); // Hello Bro
    
    printf("You are %d years old",age); // You are 21 years old
    
    printf("Your average grade is %c", grade);
    // Your average grade is C
    
    printf("Your gpa is %f\n", gpa);
    // %0.15f = 15 decimal point
    // Your gpa is 2.05000
    return 0;
}
```



---



#### Data Types in C

- **char a = 'C';**  (Single character %c)
- **char b[] = "Bro";**  (Array of characters %s)
- **char f = 100;** (1 byte (-128 to +127) %d or %c)
- **unsigned char g = 255;** (1 byte (0 to +255) %d or %c)
- **float c = 3.141592;**  (4 bytes (32 bits of precision) 6 - 7 digits %f)
- **double d = 3.141592653589793;** (8 bytes (64 bits of precision) 15- 16 digits %lf)
- **int j = 2121323;**  (4 bytes (-2147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647) %d)
- **short int h = 32767;** (2 bytes (-32,768 to +32767) %d)
- **unsigned short int i = 65535;** (2 bytes (0 to +65535) %d)
- **unsigned int k = 4294967295;** (4 bytes (0 to +4,294967295) %u)
- **bool e = true;** (1 byte (true of false) %d) #include <stdbool.h>

---



#### Format Specifier % 

Defines and formats a type of data to be displayed.

- %c - character
- %s - string (array of characters)
- %f - float
- %lf - double
- %d - integer
- %.1 - decimal precision
- %1 - minimum field width
- % - left align

---



#### Constants

fixed value that cannot be altered by the program during its execution.

It's a good practice to change the variable name to uppercase.



```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    const float PI = 3.14159;

	printf("%f\n", PI);
    return 0;
}

```



---



#### User Inputs

fgets and scanf are both used to read input from the user.

1. **fgets:** a function used to read a line of text from the standard input and store it as a string.

   Syntax: `fgets(buffer, size, stdin);`

   Parameters:

   - `buffer`: A pointer to a character array (string) where the input will be stored.
   - `size`: The maximum number of characters to read, including the null terminator.
   - `stdin`: The standard input stream, usually `stdin` (the keyboard).
   - fgets reads characters from the input stream until it encounters a newline character(`'\n'`) or reaches the specified size limit.

2. **scanf:** a function used to read formatted input from the standard input and assign values to variables.

   Syntax: `scanf(format, &variable);`

   Parameters:

   - `format`: A string specifying the format of the input to be read. It can include format specifiers like `%d` for integers, `%f` for floats, `%s` for strings, etc.
   - `&variable`: The address of the variable where the input value will be stored.
   - scanf skips leading whitespace characters (such as spaces, tabs and newline characters) and reads characters based on the specified format until it encounters whitespace or reaches the end of the input.

```c
int main(){
    char name[25]; // bytes
    int age;
    
    printf("What's your name?\n ");
    fgets(name, 25, stdin);
    
    printf("How old are you?\n");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    
    printf("Hello %s, how are you?", name);
    printf("You are %d years old", age);
 	return 0;
}
```



**Note:** You will notice that the output will be displayed on the next line. That's because when using the fgets function, it will include a newline character when you hit ENTER. 

To get rid of that newline whenever you hit ENTER, 

```c
#include <string.h>

int main(){
    char name[25];
    //Just below the fgets function, 
    name[strlen(name)-1] = '\0';
}
```





---



#### Math functions

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h> // Must be included.

int main(){
    double A = sqrt(9); // 3.000000
    double B = pow(2,4); // 16.000000
    int C = round(3.14); // 3
    int D = ceil(3.14); // 4
    int E = floor(3.99); // 3
    double F = fas(-100); // 100 
    double G = log(3); // 1.098612
	double H = sin(45); // 0.850904
	double I = cos(45); // 0.525322
	double J = tan(45); //1.619775

    
    return 0;
}
```



---



#### Switch

A more efficient alternative to using many "else if" statements. It allows a value to be tested for equality against many cases.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h> // To be able to convert uppercase or lowercase the input.

int main(){
    char grade;
    
    printf("What is your grade? \n");
    scanf("%c", &grade);
    
    //Conver the input grade to uppercase
    grade = toupper(grade);
    
    switch(grade){
        case 'A':
            printf("Perfect!\n");
            break;
        case 'B':
            printf("You did good!\n");
            break;
        case 'C':
            printf("You did okay!\n");
            break;
        case 'D':
            printf("At least it's not an F!\n");
            break;
        case 'F':
            printf("YOU FAILED!\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Please enter only valid grades");
            
    }
    
    return 0;
}

```

    char string1[] = "Sun";
    char string2[] = "Moon";
    
    // appends string2 to the end of string1

        sum += array[i];
    }
    return sum / (float) length;
}
```

---

### Key Differences:

- **Memory Allocation:**
  - `char arr[]` allocates contiguous memory for the characters of the string and null terminator.
  - `char *arr[]` allocates memory for an array of pointers, where each pointer can point to a different string.
- **Modification:**
  - You can modify `char arr[]` directly because it's an array of characters.
  - You can modify `char *arr[]` to point to different strings, but modifying the string literals themselves (`"apples"`, etc.) directly is not allowed because they are typically stored in read-only memory.
- **Usage:**
  - `char arr[]` is used for a single mutable string.
  - `char *arr[]` is used for an array of mutable pointers to strings or string literals.

In summary, `char arr[] = {"apples"}` represents a single mutable string stored as an array of characters, while `char *arr[] = {"apples"}` represents an array of pointers where each pointer can point to a string or string literal. The choice between them depends on whether you need a single mutable string (`char arr[]`) or an array of pointers to strings (`char *arr[]`).

#### `strcasecmp()` and `strcmp()`

To use the `strcasecmp` function in C, we need to include the `strings.h` header file. 

- This function is used to compare two strings in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's a brief example of how to use `strcasecmp`:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <strings.h>

int main() {
    const char *str1 = "Hello";
    const char *str2 = "hello";

    if (strcasecmp(str1, str2) == 0) {
        printf("The strings are equal (case-insensitive comparison).\n");
    } else {
        printf("The strings are not equal (case-insensitive comparison).\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The `strcasecmp` function is used to compare `str1` and `str2` without considering the case of the characters.
- If `strcasecmp` returns 0, the strings are considered equal.
- Otherwise, the strings are considered not equal.



There are important differences between `strcmp` and `strcasecmp` in C:

1. **Case Sensitivity**:
   - `strcmp`: This function compares two strings in a case-sensitive manner. This means it distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase characters.
   - `strcasecmp`: This function compares two strings in a case-insensitive manner. It treats uppercase and lowercase characters as equivalent.
2. **Function Signatures**:
   - `strcmp`: The signature is `int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);`
   - `strcasecmp`: The signature is `int strcasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);`
3. **Return Values**: Both functions return an integer value:
   - If the strings are equal, both functions return `0`.
   - If the first non-matching character in `s1` is less than the corresponding character in `s2`, both functions return a negative value.
   - If the first non-matching character in `s1` is greater than the corresponding character in `s2`, both functions return a positive value.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <strings.h>

int main() {
    const char *str1 = "Hello";
    const char *str2 = "hello";

    // Case-sensitive comparison
    if (strcmp(str1, str2) == 0) {
        printf("strcmp: The strings are equal.\n");
    } else {
        printf("strcmp: The strings are not equal.\n");
    }

    // Case-insensitive comparison
    if (strcasecmp(str1, str2) == 0) {
        printf("strcasecmp: The strings are equal.\n");
    } else {
        printf("strcasecmp: The strings are not equal.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```sh
strcmp: The strings are not equal.
strcasecmp: The strings are equal.
```

In this example, `strcmp` reports that the strings are not equal because it considers the case of the characters, while `strcasecmp` reports that the strings are equal because it ignores the case of the characters.



#### `strncasecmp()`

The `strncasecmp` function in C is similar to `strcasecmp` but with an additional parameter that limits the number of characters to compare. This function performs a case-insensitive comparison of the first `n` characters of two strings.

### Function Signature

```C
int strncasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);
```

### Parameters

- `s1`: A pointer to the first null-terminated string.
- `s2`: A pointer to the second null-terminated string.
- `n`: The maximum number of characters to compare.

### Return Value

The return value is similar to `strcmp` and `strcasecmp`:

- If the first `n` characters of `s1` and `s2` are equal (ignoring case), the function returns `0`.
- If the first non-matching character in `s1` is less than the corresponding character in `s2`, the function returns a negative value.
- If the first non-matching character in `s1` is greater than the corresponding character in `s2`, the function returns a positive value.

### Example Usage

Here's an example to illustrate how `strncasecmp` works:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <strings.h>

int main() {
    const char *str1 = "HelloWorld";
    const char *str2 = "helloEveryone";

    // Compare first 5 characters in a case-insensitive manner
    if (strncasecmp(str1, str2, 5) == 0) {
        printf("The first 5 characters of the strings are equal (case-insensitive comparison).\n");
    } else {
        printf("The first 5 characters of the strings are not equal (case-insensitive comparison).\n");
    }

    // Compare first 10 characters in a case-insensitive manner
    if (strncasecmp(str1, str2, 10) == 0) {
        printf("The first 10 characters of the strings are equal (case-insensitive comparison).\n");
    } else {
        printf("The first 10 characters of the strings are not equal (case-insensitive comparison).\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```sh
The first 5 characters of the strings are equal (case-insensitive comparison).
The first 10 characters of the strings are not equal (case-insensitive comparison).
```

In this example:

- When comparing the first 5 characters, `strncasecmp` considers the strings equal because "Hello" and "hello" match in a case-insensitive manner.
- When comparing the first 10 characters, `strncasecmp` finds a difference beyond the 5th character ("W" vs "E"), so it determines the strings are not equal.

### `Struct`

In C, a struct (short for "structure") is a user-defined data type that allows us to **group variables of different types under a single name**. This is particularly useful for organizing complex data and creating more readable and maintainable code.

#### Purpose of `struct`in C

**Grouping Related Data:** Structures allow us to group related variables (of different types) together. For example, we can group a person's name, age, and address into a single structure.
**Data Organization:** Structures help in organizing data in a logical and coherent manner, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
**Complex Data Types:** Structures enable the creation of complex data types that can represent real-world entities more accurately.
**Memory Management:** Structures provide a way to manage memory more efficiently by allocating memory for related data in a contiguous block.

#### Example

Consider an example where we need to store information about a person, including their name, age, and address. Using a structure, we can group these related pieces of information together.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

// Define a struct to represent a person
struct Person{
    char name[50];
    int age;
    char address[100];
};

int main(){
    // Declare and initialize a variable of type struct Person;
    struct Person person1;
    
    // Assign values to the members of the structure
    strcpy(person1.name, "John Doe");
    person1.age = 30;
    strcpy(person.address, "123 Main St, Anytown, USA");
    
    // Print the values of the struct members
    printf("Name: %s\n", person1.name);
    printf("Age: %d\n", person1.age);
    printf("Address %s\n", person1.address);
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

**Define the Structure:** The struct Person is defined with three members: name, age, and address.
**Declare a Variable:** A variable person1 of type struct Person is declared.
**Assign Values:** Values are assigned to the members of the structure using the dot operator (.).
**Access and Print Values:** The values of the structure members are accessed and printed using the dot operator.

#### Output

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Name: John Doe
Age: 30
Address: 123 Main St, Anytown, USA
```

#### Key Points

- **Dot Operator**: The dot operator (`.`) is used to access members of a structure.
- **Memory Allocation**: Memory for the structure is allocated in a contiguous block, with each member occupying a portion of that block.
- **Nested Structures**: Structures can be nested within other structures to represent more complex data.

Using structures in C helps in creating more organized and manageable code, especially when dealing with complex data types.

### `uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t`

The types `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, and `uint64_t` are fixed-width integer types defined in the `<stdint.h>` header in C. They specify unsigned integer types with exact widths, which makes them useful for ensuring consistent behavior across different platforms.

#### Differences:

1. **Width**:
   - `uint8_t`: 8 bits (1 byte)
   - `uint16_t`: 16 bits (2 bytes)
   - `uint32_t`: 32 bits (4 bytes)
   - `uint64_t`: 64 bits (8 bytes)
2. **Range**:
   - `uint8_t`: 0 to 255
   - `uint16_t`: 0 to 65,535
   - `uint32_t`: 0 to 4,294,967,295
   - `uint64_t`: 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615

#### Usage:

- **`uint8_t`**: Often used for small data, such as bytes or small counters.
- **`uint16_t`**: Used for larger counters or small arrays.
- **`uint32_t`**: Commonly used for larger counters, array indices, or data that requires more than 16 bits but less than 32 bits.
- **`uint64_t`**: Used for very large numbers, such as file sizes, timestamps, or other data requiring a large range.

#### Example:

```C
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    uint8_t small_number = 255;
    uint16_t medium_number = 65535;
    uint32_t large_number = 4294967295;
    uint64_t very_large_number = 18446744073709551615U;

    printf("uint8_t: %u\n", small_number);
    printf("uint16_t: %u\n", medium_number);
    printf("uint32_t: %u\n", large_number);
    printf("uint64_t: %llu\n", very_large_number);

    return 0;
}
```

### Delimiters

Delimiters are characters or sequences of characters that are used to specify the boundary between separate, independent regions in plain text or other data streams. They are essential in parsing and processing strings, as they help to split the string into meaningful components.

#### Common Delimiters

- **Comma (`,`)**: Often used in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.
- **Space (` `)**: Commonly used to separate words in a sentence.
- **Hyphen (`-`)**: Can be used to separate parts of a compound word or identifier.
- **Colon (`:`)**: Often used in key-value pairs.
- **Semicolon (`;`)**: Used to separate statements in programming languages like C and JavaScript.
- **Pipe (`|`)**: Used in command-line interfaces to separate commands.

#### Example with Different Delimiters

##### Using a Comma as a Delimiter

- If we want to use a comma (`,`) as a delimiter, we can modify the format string to `"%[^,],%[^,]"`.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    // Define variables
    char input[30];
    char color1[10], color2[10];

    // Get the input as a single string
    printf("Enter the colors (e.g, brown,green): ");
    scanf("%s", input);

    // Split the input by the comma
    sscanf(input, "%[^,],%[^,]", color1, color2);

    // Print the parsed colors
    printf("Color 1: %s\n", color1);
    printf("Color 2: %s\n", color2);

    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown,green): brown,green
Color 1: brown
Color 2: green
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown,green): Brown,Green,Blue
Color 1: Brown
Color 2: Green
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown,green): Brown-Green
Color 1: Brown-Green
Color 2: �
```

##### Using a Space as a Delimiter

- If we want to use a space ( ) as a delimiter, we can modify the format string to `%s %s` or `%[^ ] %[^ ]`.
- Here, we won't be using `scanf` due to the fact that: 
  - The `scanf` function reads the input until the first white-space, which means it will only capture the first word. 
  - Therefore, the input variable will only contain the first color, and the second color will not be captured.
- Thus, we will use `fgets` to read the entire line of input, including spaces, and then use `sscanf` to parse the colors.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    // Define variables
    char input[30];
    char color1[10], color2[10];

    // Get the input as a single string
    printf("Enter the colors (e.g, brown green): ");
    scanf("%s", input);

    // Split the input by the space
    sscanf(input, "%s %s", color1, color2);

    // Print the parsed colors
    printf("Color 1: %s\n", color1);
    printf("Color 2: %s\n", color2);

    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown green): brown green red
Color 1: brown
Color 2: green
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown green): brown green
Color 1: brown
Color 2: green
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown green): Brown Green
Color 1: Brown
Color 2: Green
```

```C
int main()
{
    // Define variables
    char input[30];
    char color1[10], color2[10];

    // Get the input as a single string
    printf("Enter the colors (e.g, brown green): ");
    fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);

    // Remove the newline character from the input string
    input[strcspn(input, "\n")] = '\0';

    // Split the input by the space
    sscanf(input, "%[^ ] %[^ ]", color1, color2);

    printf("Color 1: %s\n", color1);
    printf("Color 2: %s\n", color2);

    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown green): brown green
Color 1: brown
Color 2: green
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown green): red blue violet
Color 1: red
Color 2: blue
```

#### Using a hyphen as a Delimiter

```C
int main()
{
    // Define variables
    char input[30];
    char color1[10], color2[10];

    // Get the input as a single string
    printf("Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): ");
    scanf("%s", input);

    // Split the input by the hyphen
    sscanf(input, "%[^-]-%[^-]", color1, color2);

    printf("Color 1: %s\n", color1);
    printf("Color 2: %s\n", color2);

    return 0;
}

```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): brown-green
Color 1: brown
Color 2: green
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): brown-green-violet
Color 1: brown
Color 2: green
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter the colors (e.g, brown-green): red-black
Color 1: red
Color 2: black
```

#### Example with `strtok`

```C
int main(){
    char input[] = "brown,green,blue";
    char *token;
    
    // Using comma as a delimiter
    token = strtok(input, ",");
    while(token != NULL){
        printf("Color: %s\n", token);
        token = strtok(NULL, ",");
    }
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Color: brown
Color: green
Color: blue
```

In this example:

- `char input[] = "brown,green,blue";` defines a string containing colors separated by commas.
- `char *token;` declares a pointer to hold each token (color) extracted from the string.
- `strtok` splits the input string into tokens separated by commas.
- The first call to `strtok` initializes the tokenization and returns the first token "brown" and stored in `token`.
- `while (token != NULL)` starts a loop that continues as long as `strtok` returns a non-NULL token.
- Subsequent calls to `strtok` with `NULL` continue tokenizing the same string.
- **Return Value**: `strtok` returns a pointer to the next token found in the string. If no more tokens are found, it returns `NULL`.

**With input**

```C
int main()
{
    char input[30];

    printf("Enter colors separated by commas (brown,green,blue): ");
    scanf("%s", input);

    char *token;

    // Using comma as a delimiter
    token = strtok(input, ",");

    while (token != NULL)
    {
        printf("Color: %s\n", token);
        token = strtok(NULL, ",");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter colors separated by commas (brown,green,blue): brown,green,blue
Color: brown
Color: green
Color: blue
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter colors separated by commas (brown,green,blue): red,hair-bright
Color: red
Color: hair-bright
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Enter colors separated by commas (brown,green,blue): red,blue,yellow,orange
Color: red
Color: blue
Color: yellow
Color: orange
```



#### Detailed Explanation of Delimiters

1. **Definition**:
   - A delimiter is a character or sequence of characters that marks the beginning or end of a unit of data.
2. **Purpose**:
   - Delimiters are used to separate data into distinct parts, making it easier to parse and process.
3. **Usage in Parsing**:
   - When parsing a string, delimiters help identify where one piece of data ends and another begins.
4. **Common Functions**:
   - `sscanf`: Uses format specifiers to parse strings based on delimiters.
   - `strtok`: Splits a string into tokens based on specified delimiters.
   - `fgets`: Reads a line from a file, often using newline characters as delimiters.
5. **Examples**:
   - CSV files use commas to separate values: `name,age,city`.
   - URLs use slashes to separate components: `http://example.com/path/to/resource`.
   - Programming languages use semicolons to separate statements: `int a = 5; int b = 10;`.

## `char *smth` vs `char smth[]`

The difference between `char *smth` and `char smth[]` in C lies in how they are used and what they represent:

### `char *smth`

- **Pointer to a Character**: `char *smth` is a pointer to a character or the first character of a string.
- **Dynamic Allocation**: It can point to dynamically allocated memory or a string literal.
- **Modifiable Pointer**: The pointer itself can be changed to point to different memory locations.

**Example**:

```C
char *str = "Hello, World!";
```

### `char smth[]`

- **Array of Characters**: `char smth[]` is an array of characters.
- **Fixed Size**: The size of the array is determined at compile time and cannot be changed.
- **Array Name as Pointer**: The name of the array acts as a pointer to the first element, but it is not modifiable.

**Example**

```C
char str[] = "Hello, World!";
```

### Key Differences

1. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `char *smth`: Points to a memory location, which can be changed.
   - `char smth[]`: Allocates memory for the array elements at compile time.
2. **Modifiability**:
   - `char *smth`: The pointer can be reassigned to point to different strings.
   - `char smth[]`: The array name cannot be reassigned, but the contents can be modified.
3. **Initialization**:
   - `char *smth`: Can be initialized with a string literal or dynamically allocated memory.
   - `char smth[]`: Typically initialized with a string literal or an initializer list.

### Example Comparison

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Using char *smth
    char *ptr = "Hello, World!";
    printf("%s\n", ptr);
    ptr = "New String"; // Pointer can be reassigned
    printf("%s\n", ptr);

    // Using char smth[]
    char arr[] = "Hello, World!";
    printf("%s\n", arr);
    // arr = "New String"; // Error: array name cannot be reassigned
    arr[0] = 'h'; // Contents can be modified
    printf("%s\n", arr);

    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Hello, World!
New String
Hello, World!
hello, World!
```



### Summary

- **`char *smth`**: A pointer to a character, can be reassigned, and can point to dynamically allocated memory.
- **`char smth[]`**: An array of characters, fixed size, and the array name cannot be reassigned but its contents can be modified.

## Normal Function vs Function Pointer

In C, a normal function and a function pointer serve different purposes. Here's a brief explanation of each:

### Normal Function

- A normal function is a block of code that performs a specific task. 
- It has a name, a return type, and parameters. 

- We call it by using its name and passing the required arguments.

#### Example

```C
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(3, 4); // Calling the normal function
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

### Function Pointer

- A function pointer is a variable that stores the address of a function. 
- We can use it to call the function indirectly. 
- Function pointers are useful for callback functions, implementing function tables, and dynamic function calls.

#### Example

```C
#include <stdio.h>

// Normal function
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    // Declare a function pointer
    int (*func_ptr)(int, int);

    // Assign the address of the function to the pointer
    func_ptr = add;

    // Call the function using the pointer
    int result = func_ptr(3, 4);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Differences

1. **Declaration**:
   - Normal Function: `return_type function_name(parameter_list)`
   - Function Pointer: `return_type (*pointer_name)(parameter_list)`
2. **Usage**:
   - Normal Function: Called directly by its name.
   - Function Pointer: Called indirectly using the pointer.
3. **Flexibility**:
   - Normal Function: Fixed at compile time.
   - Function Pointer: Can point to different functions at runtime, providing more flexibility.

### Note

```C
char *to_rna(const char *dna){
    ...
}
```

#### Is the function `to_rna` a pointer function?

- The answer is No. It's a normal function that **returns a pointer** to a `char` (a string).

#### Explanation

- **Normal Function**: `to_rna` is a normal function because it is defined with a standard function signature and is called directly by its name.
- **Returns a Pointer**: The function returns a pointer to a `char`(`char *`), which is a common practice when dealing with strings in C.
- `char *to_rna(const char *dna)` indicates that `to_rna` is a function that takes a `const char *` as an argument and returns a `char *`.
- `to_rna` is a normal function that returns a pointer to a `char`. It is not a function pointer or a pointer function.

## `malloc` vs `calloc`

- Both `calloc` and `malloc` are used for dynamic memory allocation in C, but they have some key differences:

### `malloc`

- **Syntax**: `void* malloc(size_t size);`
- **Functionality**: Allocates a block of memory of the specified size (in bytes) but does not initialize the memory. The content of the allocated memory is indeterminate (it could contain garbage values).
- **Use Case**: Ideal when we need to allocate memory and we plan to initialize it ourselves immediately after allocation.

### `calloc`

- **Syntax**: `void* calloc(size_t num, size_t size);`
- **Functionality**: Allocates memory for an array of `num` elements, each of `size` bytes, and initializes all bytes in the allocated memory to zero.
- **Use Case**: Ideal when we need to allocate and initialize memory to zero. This is particularly useful for arrays or structures where we want to ensure all elements are initially zero.

### Example

`malloc`

```C
int *arr = (int*)malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
if (arr == NULL) {
    // Handle allocation failure
}
// Initialize the array
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    arr[i] = 0;
}
```

`calloc`

```C
int *arr = (int*)calloc(10, sizeof(int));
if (arr == NULL) {
    // Handle allocation failure
}
// No need to initialize, as calloc already sets all elements to 0
```

### Summary

- **`malloc`**: Use when you need to allocate memory quickly and will handle initialization yourself.
- **`calloc`**: Use when you need zero-initialized memory, which can save you the step of manually setting the memory to zero.

## Dangling Pointers

### Definition

- A dangling pointer is a pointer which points to some non-existing memory location.
- A **dangling pointer** in C refers to a pointer that points to memory that has been **freed** or **deallocated**, but the pointer itself has not been updated and still holds the old address. 
- Accessing or dereferencing a dangling pointer can lead to undefined behavior, which can cause program crashes, memory corruption, or unexpected results.

### Causes of Dangling Pointers:

1. **Freeing Memory but Not Nullifying the Pointer**: 
   - When you use `free()` to deallocate memory but don’t update the pointer to `NULL`, the pointer still holds the address of the deallocated memory. 
   - This becomes a dangling pointer.

```C
int *ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
free(ptr); // Memory is freed
// ptr is now dangling since it still holds the old address
```

2. **Returning Pointers to Local Variables**: 

   - Returning a pointer to a local variable from a function can lead to a dangling pointer because local variables are destroyed when the function exits, and the memory they occupied is invalid.

   ```C
   int* ptr;
   {
       int temp = 42;
       ptr = &temp; // Dangling pointer: temp goes out of scope after the block ends
   }
   
   ```

   ```C
   int* fun(){
       int num = 10;
       return &num;
   }
   
   int main(){
       int *ptr = NULL;
       ptr = fun();
       printf("%d", *ptr);
       return 0;
   }
   
   // This will result in Segmentation fault which means we are trying to read or write to an illegal memory location.
   
   // num is local to fun() function.
   // After fun() finishes its execution, the num variable will get vanished which means it will no longer exist.
   // Which means memory has been deallocated.
   // We are trying to return the address of the deallocated memory and we are simply returnign the address of non-existent memory.
   ```

   

3. **Scope Issues**: If a pointer points to a variable that goes out of scope, the pointer becomes dangling because the variable no longer exists in memory.

   ```C
   int* ptr;
   {
       int temp = 42;
       ptr = &temp; // Dangling pointer: temp goes out of scope after the block ends
   }
   ```

### How to Prevent Dangling Pointers:

- **Set pointers to `NULL`** after freeing memory: 

  ```C
  free(ptr);
  ptr = NULL;  // Now it's not dangling; dereferencing NULL leads to a clear error
  ```

- **Avoid returning pointers to local variables** from functions.

- Be careful when working with pointers to objects with limited scope.

## Possible Outcomes of Double-Freeing Memory

- If we attempt to **double free** memory in C—meaning we try to free the same block of memory more than once—it can lead to **undefined behavior**. 
- This means the behavior of our program is unpredictable, and the consequences can vary depending on the system, compiler, or runtime environment.

1. **Program Crash (Segmentation Fault)**:
   - In many cases, double freeing memory will result in a segmentation fault. 
   - This happens because the program tries to free a block of memory that is no longer valid, causing the system to detect the illegal operation and terminate the program.
2. **Memory Corruption**:
   - Double freeing can corrupt the heap, the area of memory where dynamically allocated data is stored. 
   - This could lead to memory management issues like corrupted pointers, making the program behave unexpectedly later on.
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**:
   - Double-free vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to perform **heap-based buffer overflow** attacks or to execute arbitrary code. 
   - This is why avoiding double-free errors is crucial in security-critical applications.
4. **Silent Failure**:
   - In some cases, especially on certain systems or compilers, double freeing may not cause an immediate crash. 
   - The program may continue to run without any obvious issues but with a potentially corrupted state, making debugging more difficult.

### Example of a Double Free:

```C
int main(){
    int *ptr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
    
    // First free
    free(ptr);
    
    // Attempting to free the same memory again
    free(ptr); // Undefined behavior (double free)
    
    return 0;
}
```

### How to Prevent Double Free:

- Set pointers to `NULL` after freeing memory:

  ```C
  free(ptr);
  ptr = NULL;  // Now, further free(ptr) calls will be safe, as freeing NULL is harmless.
  ```

  - In C, freeing a `NULL` pointer is a no-op (it does nothing), so this is a safe guard against double frees.

- By ensuring that pointers are set to `NULL` after freeing memory and being cautious with memory management, we can avoid double-free errors and undefined behavior in our program.
