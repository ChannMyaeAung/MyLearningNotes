# The all operator

- The `all` operator allows us to make comparisons between a single value and every value in a set.
- To build such a condition, we will need to use one of the comparison operators (=, <>, <, >, etc) in conjunction with the `all` operator.
- The following query finds all customers who have never gotten a free film rental.

```bash
mysql> SELECT first_name, last_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE customer_id <> ALL
    -> (SELECT customer_id
    -> FROM payment
    -> WHERE amount = 0);
...
...
| TERRENCE    | GUNDERSON    |
| ENRIQUE     | FORSYTHE     |
| FREDDIE     | DUGGAN       |
| WADE        | DELVALLE     |
| AUSTIN      | CINTRON      |
+-------------+--------------+
576 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

- The following query generates the same results as the previous one, which uses the `not in` operator.

```bash
mysql> SELECT first_name, last_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE customer_id NOT IN
    -> (SELECT customer_id
    -> FROM payment
    -> WHERE amount = 0);
+-------------+--------------+
| first_name  | last_name    |
+-------------+--------------+
| MARY        | SMITH        |
| PATRICIA    | JOHNSON      |
| LINDA       | WILLIAMS     |
...
...
...
| TERRENCE    | GUNDERSON    |
| ENRIQUE     | FORSYTHE     |
| FREDDIE     | DUGGAN       |
| WADE        | DELVALLE     |
| AUSTIN      | CINTRON      |
+-------------+--------------+
576 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

**Note**: When using `not in` or `<> all` to compare a value to a set of values, one must be careful to ensure that the set of values does not contain a `null` value.

- Because the server equates the value on the lefthand side of the expression to each memeber of the set.
- and any attempt to equate a value to `null` yields `unknown`.

```bash
mysql> SELECT first_name, last_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE customer_id NOT IN (122, 452, NULL);
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```



## Example - 1

`> ALL` - True if the left-hand value is greater than every value in the subquery.

- “Find films whose rental rate is higher than every film in category 8”

```bash
mysql> SELECT title, rental_rate
    -> FROM film
    -> WHERE rental_rate > ALL (
    -> SELECT rental_rate
    -> FROM film
    -> JOIN film_category USING(film_id)
    -> WHERE category_id = 8
    -> );
Empty set (0.03 sec)
```

`< ALL`

- “Find the customer who rented on the earliest time of 2005-07-01”

```bash
mysql> SELECT customer_id, rental_date
    -> FROM rental
    -> WHERE rental_date < ALL (
    -> SELECT rental_date
    -> FROM rental
    -> WHERE DATE(rental_date) = '2005-07-01'
    -> );
...
...
|         274 | 2006-02-14 15:16:03 |
|         374 | 2006-02-14 15:16:03 |
|         216 | 2006-02-14 15:16:03 |
|         532 | 2006-02-14 15:16:03 |
|         373 | 2006-02-14 15:16:03 |
+-------------+---------------------+
16044 rows in set (0.04 sec)
```





## Example - 2

- Another example using the `all` operator, but this time the subquery is in the `having` clause.
- The following subquery returns the total number of film rentals for all customers in North America, and the containing query returns all customers whose total number of film rentals exceeds any of the North American customers.

```bash
mysql> SELECT customer_id, count(*)
    -> FROM rental
    -> GROUP BY customer_id
    -> HAVING count(*) > ALL
    -> (SELECT count(*)
    -> FROM rental r
    -> INNER JOIN customer c
    -> ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
    -> INNER JOIN address a
    -> ON c.address_id = a.address_id
    -> INNER JOIN city ct
    -> ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
    -> INNER JOIN country co
    -> ON ct.country_id = co.country_id
    -> WHERE co.country IN ('United States', 'Mexico', 'Canada')
    -> GROUP BY r.customer_id
    -> );
+-------------+----------+
| customer_id | count(*) |
+-------------+----------+
|         148 |       46 |
+-------------+----------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
```
