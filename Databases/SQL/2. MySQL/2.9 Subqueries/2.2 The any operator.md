# The any operator

- Like `all` operator, the `any` operator allows a value to be compared to the members of a set of values.
- Unlike `all`, `any` evaluates to true as soon as a single comparison is favorable.
- `x = ANY (...)` is effectively the same as `x IN (...)`. Though `IN` also automatically rejects `NULL` from the set.

## Difference with `ALL` 

| Operator | Returns TRUE if...                                         | Typical Use Case                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ANY      | At least one value in the subquery satisfies the condition | To check if a value matches any value in a set |
| ALL      | Every value in the subquery satisfies the condition        | To ensure a value matches all values in a set  |
