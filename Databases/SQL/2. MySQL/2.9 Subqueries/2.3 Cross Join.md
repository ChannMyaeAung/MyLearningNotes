# Cross Join

- A **CROSS JOIN** produces the *Cartesian product* of two tables: 
  - every row in the first table is paired with *every* row in the second. 
  - There is **no** join condition.

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM tableA
CROSS JOIN tableB;
```

is equivalent to

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM tableA, tableB;
```

and is not the same as an `INNER JOIN` with an `ON` clause.

**Note**: An `INNER JOIN` only returns pairs where the join condition is satisfied.

## Example

- Suppose we want every combination of films and categories to build a matrix of "film x category" whether or not that film actually belongs to that category.

```bash
mysql> SELECT f.title AS film_title,
    -> c.name AS category_name
    -> FROM film AS f
    -> CROSS JOIN category AS c
    -> LIMIT 10;
+------------------+---------------+
| film_title       | category_name |
+------------------+---------------+
