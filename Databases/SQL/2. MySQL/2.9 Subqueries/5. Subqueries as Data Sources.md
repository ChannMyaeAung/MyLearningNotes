# Subqueries as Data Sources

- The following subquery generates a list of customer IDs along with the number of film rentals and the total payments.
- The containing query then retrieves the customer's name from the `customer` table, along with the summary column from the `pymnt` subquery.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name,
    -> pymnt.num_rentals, pymnt.tot_payments
    -> FROM customer c
    -> INNER JOIN
    -> (SELECT customer_id,
    -> count(*) num_rentals, sum(amount) tot_payments
    -> FROM payment
    -> GROUP BY customer_id
    -> ) pymnt
    -> ON c.customer_id = pymnt.customer_id;

- **Note**: Subqueries used in the `from` clause must be non-correlated.
  - They are executed first, and the data is held in memory until the containing query finishes execution.
- Subqueries offer immense flexibility when writing queries, because we can go far beyond the set of available tables to create virtually any view of the data that we desire and then join the results to other tables or subqueries.
  - In the following query, for each customer row `c`, MySQL runs the inner `count(*)` query to produce a "scalar" value.
  - We've effectively extended the `customer` table with a "virtual" `total_rentals` column.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name,
    -> (SELECT count(*)
    -> FROM rental AS r
    -> WHERE r.customer_id = c.customer_id
    -> ) AS total_rentals
    -> FROM customer AS c
    -> LIMIT 5;
