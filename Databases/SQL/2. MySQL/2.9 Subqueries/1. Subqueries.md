# Subqueries

Subqueries let us:

- Encapsulate logic in a smaller query
- Feed results into a surrounding (outer) query
- Avoid temporary tables for many lookups

```bash
mysql> SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE customer_id = (SELECT MAX(customer_id) FROM customer);
+-------------+------------+-----------+
| customer_id | first_name | last_name |
+-------------+------------+-----------+
|         599 | AUSTIN     | CINTRON   |
+-------------+------------+-----------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
```

## Subquery Types

### Non-correlated Subqueries

- Runs independently of the outer query; executes just once, then the outer query sees its result.
- Most subqueries will be of this type unless there's `update` or `delete` statements, which frequently make use of correlated subqueries.

```bash
mysql> SELECT title
    -> FROM film
    -> WHERE film_id = (
    -> SELECT MAX(film_id)
    -> FROM film);
+-----------+
| title     |
+-----------+
| ZORRO ARK |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

- The following query returns all cities that are not in India.

```bash
mysql> SELECT city_id, city
    -> FROM city
    -> WHERE country_id <>
    -> (SELECT country_id FROM country WHERE country = 'India');
...
...
...
|     590 | Yuncheng                   |
|     591 | Yuzhou                     |
|     592 | Zalantun                   |
|     593 | Zanzibar                   |
|     594 | Zaoyang                    |
|     595 | Zapopan                    |
|     596 | Zaria                      |
|     597 | Zeleznogorsk               |
|     598 | Zhezqazghan                |
|     599 | Zhoushan                   |
|     600 | Ziguinchor                 |
+---------+----------------------------+
540 rows in set (0.04 sec)
```

- When using a subquery in an equality condition but the subquery returns more than one row, we will receive an error.

```bash
mysql> SELECT city_id, city
    -> FROM city
    -> WHERE country_id <>
    -> (SELECT country_id FROM country WHERE country <> 'India');
ERROR 1242 (21000): Subquery returns more than 1 row
```

- But if we run it by itself,

```bash
mysql> SELECT country_id FROM country WHERE country <> 'India';
+------------+
| country_id |
+------------+
|          1 |
|          2 |
|          3 |
|          4 |
|          5 |
...
...
|        100 |
|        101 |
|        102 |
|        103 |
|        104 |
|        105 |
|        106 |
|        107 |
|        108 |
|        109 |
+------------+
108 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- The containing query fails because an expression (`country_id`) cannot be equated to a set of expressions (`country_id` 1,2,3,..., 109).
- A single thing cannot be equated to a set of things.

### Correlated

- dependent on its containing statement from which it references one or more columns.
- Refers to columns of the outer query.
- Re-executes once per outer row.
- Thus, the use of correlated subqueries can cause performance issues if the containing query returns a large number of rows.
- The following query counts for each customer,  how many rentals theyâ€™ve made.

```sql
SELECT first_name, department_id, salary
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e2.department_id = e1.department_id
);

```

**Explanation:**

- The outer query alias is `e1`.
- The subquery calculates the average salary for the department of the current employee (`e1.department_id`).
- For each employee row, the subquery runs to find that department's average salary.
- The outer query returns only employees earning more than their department's average.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name,
    -> (SELECT COUNT(*)
    -> FROM rental r
    -> WHERE r.customer_id = c.customer_id) AS rentals
    -> FROM customer AS c;
+-------------+-------------+---------+
| customer_id | first_name  | rentals |
+-------------+-------------+---------+
|           1 | MARY        |      32 |
|           2 | PATRICIA    |      27 |
|           3 | LINDA       |      26 |
|           4 | BARBARA     |      22 |
|           5 | ELIZABETH   |      38 |

|         596 | ENRIQUE     |      28 |
|         597 | FREDDIE     |      25 |
|         598 | WADE        |      22 |
|         599 | AUSTIN      |      19 |
+-------------+-------------+---------+
599 rows in set (0.09 sec)
```

#### Example - 2

- The following query uses a correlated subquery to count the number of films rentals for each customer, and the containing query then retrieves those customers who have rented exactly 20 films.
  - The containing query retrieves all 599 rows from the `customer` table and executes the subquery once for each customer.
  - Passing in the appropriate customer ID for each execution.
  - If the subquery returns the value 20, then the filter condition is met and the row is added to the result set.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE 20 =
    -> (SELECT count(*) FROM rental r
    -> WHERE r.customer_id = c.customer_id);
+------------+-------------+
| first_name | last_name   |
+------------+-------------+
| LAUREN     | HUDSON      |
| JEANETTE   | GREENE      |
| TARA       | RYAN        |
| WILMA      | RICHARDS    |
| JO         | FOWLER      |
| KAY        | CALDWELL    |
| DANIEL     | CABRAL      |
| ANTHONY    | SCHWAB      |
| TERRY      | GRISSOM     |
| LUIS       | YANEZ       |
| HERBERT    | KRUGER      |
| OSCAR      | AQUINO      |
| RAUL       | FORTIER     |
| NELSON     | CHRISTENSON |
| ALFREDO    | MCADAMS     |
+------------+-------------+
15 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- The reference to `c.customer_id` at the very end of the subquery is what makes the subquery correlated.
- The containing query must supply values for `c.customer_id` for the subquery to execute.

## Example - 3 

- Along with equality conditions, we can use correlated subqueries in other types of conditions such as the range condition.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE
    -> (SELECT sum(p.amount)
    -> FROM payment p
    -> WHERE p.customer_id = c.customer_id)
    -> BETWEEN 180 and 240;

| ELEANOR    | HUNT      |
| MARION     | SNYDER    |
| TOMMY      | COLLAZO   |
| KARL       | SEAL      |
+------------+-----------+
6 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```
