# Common table expressions

- A CTE is a named subquery thaat appears at the top of a query in a `with clause`, which can contain multiple CTEs separated by commas.
- Along with making queries more understandable, this feature also allows each CTE to refer to any other CTE defined above it in the same `with` clause.
- The following query includes three CTEs, where the second refers to the first and the third refers to the second.
  - the query calculates the total revenues generated from PG-rated film rentals where the cast includes an actor whose last name starts with S.
  - The first sub-query (`actors_s`) finds all actors whose last name starts with S, 
  - the second `actors_s_pg` joins that data set to the `film` table and filters on films having a PG rating, 
  - The third subquery `actors_s_pg_revenue` joins that data set to the `payment` table to retrieve the amounts paid to rent any of these films.
  - The final query simply groups the data from `actors_s_pg_revenue` by first/last names and sums the revenues.
