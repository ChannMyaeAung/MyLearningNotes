# The exists Operator

- The most common operator used to build conditions that utilize correlated subqueries is the `exists` operator.
- Use when we want to identify that a relationship exists without regard for the quantity.
- The following query finds all the customers who rented at least one film prior to May 25, 2005, without regard for how many films were rented.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE EXISTS
    -> (SELECT 1 FROM rental r
    -> WHERE r.customer_id = c.customer_id
    -> AND date(r.rental_date) < '2005-05-25');
+------------+-------------+
| first_name | last_name   |
+------------+-------------+
| CHARLOTTE  | HUNTER      |
| DELORES    | HANSEN      |
| MINNIE     | ROMERO      |
| CASSANDRA  | WALTERS     |
| ANDREW     | PURDY       |
| MANUEL     | MURRELL     |
| TOMMY      | COLLAZO     |
| NELSON     | CHRISTENSON |
+------------+-------------+
8 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

- `EXISTS` tests whether the subquery returns **at least one row**. If it does, the condition is true and that customer is included.

- The `select` clause of our subquery is 1 since the condition in the containing query only needs to know how many rows have been returned, the actual data the subquery returned is irrelevant as shown below.
  - However, the convention is to specify either `select 1` or `select *` when using `exists`.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE EXISTS
    -> (SELECT r.rental_date, r.customer_id, 'ABCD' str,
    -> 2 * 3 / 7 nmbr
    -> FROM rental r
    -> WHERE r.customer_id = c.customer_id
    -> AND date(r.rental_date) < '2005-05-25');
+------------+-------------+
| first_name | last_name   |
+------------+-------------+
| CHARLOTTE  | HUNTER      |
| DELORES    | HANSEN      |
| MINNIE     | ROMERO      |
| CASSANDRA  | WALTERS     |
| ANDREW     | PURDY       |
| MANUEL     | MURRELL     |
| TOMMY      | COLLAZO     |
| NELSON     | CHRISTENSON |
+------------+-------------+
8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## Not exists

- Check for subqueries that return no rows.
- The following query finds all actors who have never appeared in an R-rated film.

```bash
mysql> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE NOT EXISTS
    -> (SELECT 1
    -> FROM film_actor fa
    -> INNER JOIN film f
    -> ON f.film_id = fa.film_id
    -> WHERE fa.actor_id = a.actor_id
    -> AND f.rating = 'R');
+------------+-----------+
| first_name | last_name |
+------------+-----------+
| JANE       | JACKMAN   |
+------------+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
