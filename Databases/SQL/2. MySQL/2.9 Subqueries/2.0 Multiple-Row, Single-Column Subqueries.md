# Multiple-Row, Single-Column Subqueries

## The in and not in operators

- While we can't equate a single value to a set of values, we can check to see whether a single value can be found within a set of values.
- The following query, while it doesn't use a subquery, shows how to build a condition that uses the `in` operator to search for a value within a  set of values.

```bash
mysql> SELECT country_id
    -> FROM country
    -> WHERE country IN ('Canada', 'Mexico');
+------------+
| country_id |
+------------+
|         20 |
|         60 |
+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- The following query uses the `in` operator with a subquery on the righthand side of the filter condition to return all cities that are in Canada or Mexico.

```bash
mysql> SELECT city_id, city
    -> FROM city
    -> WHERE country_id IN
    -> (SELECT country_id
    -> FROM country
    -> WHERE country IN ('Canada','Mexico'));
+---------+----------------------------+
| city_id | city                       |
+---------+----------------------------+
|     179 | Gatineau                   |
|     196 | Halifax                    |
|     300 | Lethbridge                 |
|     313 | London                     |
|     383 | Oshawa                     |
...
...
|     365 | Nezahualcóyotl             |
|     393 | Pachuca de Soto            |
|     445 | Salamanca                  |
|     451 | San Felipe del Progreso    |
|     452 | San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec |
|     541 | Torreón                    |
|     556 | Uruapan                    |
|     563 | Valle de Santiago          |
|     595 | Zapopan                    |
+---------+----------------------------+
37 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- Below is another version of the previous query using `not in` instead of `in`.

```bash
mysql> SELECT city_id, city
    -> FROM city
    -> WHERE country_id NOT IN
    -> (SELECT country_id
    -> FROM country
    -> WHERE country IN ('Canada','Mexico'));
... 
...
|     593 | Zanzibar                   |
|     594 | Zaoyang                    |
|     596 | Zaria                      |
|     597 | Zeleznogorsk               |
|     598 | Zhezqazghan                |
|     599 | Zhoushan                   |
|     600 | Ziguinchor                 |
+---------+----------------------------+
563 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
