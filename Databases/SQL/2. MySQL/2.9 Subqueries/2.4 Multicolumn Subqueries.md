# Multicolumn Subqueries

- The following query uses two subqueries to identify all actors with the last name Monroe and all films rated PG.
  - The containing query then uses this info to retrieve all cases where an actor named Monroe appeared in a PG film.

```bash
mysql> SELECT fa.actor_id, fa.film_id
    -> FROM film_actor fa
    -> WHERE fa.actor_id IN
    -> (SELECT actor_id FROM actor WHERE last_name = 'MONROE')
    -> AND fa.film_id IN
    -> (SELECT film_id
    -> FROM film
    -> WHERE rating = 'PG');
+----------+---------+
| actor_id | film_id |
+----------+---------+
|      120 |      63 |
|      120 |     144 |
|      120 |     414 |
|      120 |     590 |
|      120 |     715 |
|      120 |     894 |
|      178 |     164 |
|      178 |     194 |
|      178 |     273 |
|      178 |     311 |
|      178 |     983 |
+----------+---------+
11 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- We could merge the two single-column subqueries into one multicolumn subquery and compare the results to two columns in the `film_actor` table.
- The filter condition must name both columns from the `film_actor` table surrounded by parentheses and in the same order as returned by the subquery.

```bash
mysql> SELECT actor_id, film_id
    -> FROM film_actor
    -> WHERE (actor_id, film_id) IN
    -> (SELECT a.actor_id, f.film_id
    -> FROM actor a
    -> CROSS JOIN film f
    -> WHERE a.last_name = 'MONROE'
    -> AND f.rating = 'PG');
+----------+---------+
| actor_id | film_id |
+----------+---------+
|      120 |      63 |
|      120 |     144 |
|      120 |     414 |
|      120 |     590 |
|      120 |     715 |
|      120 |     894 |
|      178 |     164 |
|      178 |     194 |
|      178 |     273 |
|      178 |     311 |
|      178 |     983 |
+----------+---------+
11 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- The query uses the same function, but with a single subquery that returns two columns instead of two subqueries that each return a single column.
