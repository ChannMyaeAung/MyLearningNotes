# Subqueries as Expression Generators

- Instead of joining `customer`, `address` and `city` tables to the payment data,

```bash
mysql> SELECT
    -> (SELECT c.first_name FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.customer_id = p.customer_id
    -> ) first_name,
    -> (SELECT c.last_name FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.customer_id = p.customer_id
    -> ) last_name,
    -> (SELECT ct.city
    -> FROM customer c
    -> INNER JOIN address a
    -> ON c.address_id = a.address_id
    -> INNER JOIN city ct
    -> ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
    -> WHERE c.customer_id = p.customer_id
    -> ) city,
    -> sum(p.amount) tot_payments,
    -> count(*) tot_rentals
    -> FROM payment p
    -> GROUP BY p.customer_id;

- The following query retrieves an actor's first and last names and sorts by the number of films in which the actor appeared.

```bash
mysql> SELECT a.actor_id, a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> ORDER BY
    -> (SELECT count(*) FROM film_actor fa
    -> WHERE fa.actor_id = a.actor_id) DESC;
+----------+-------------+--------------+
| actor_id | first_name  | last_name    |

## Non-correlated scalar subqueries

- Along with using correlated scalar subqueries in `select` statements, we can use non-correlated ones to generate values for an `insert` statement. 
- Let's say we are generating a new row in the `film_actor` table and given "the first and last name of the actor" and the name of the film.
- We have two choices:
  - Execute two queries to retrieve the primary key values from `film` and `actor` and place those values into an `insert` statement 
  - Use subqueries to retrieve the two key values from within an `insert` statement.

```bash
mysql> INSERT INTO film_actor(actor_id, film_id, last_update)
    -> VALUES(
    -> (SELECT actor_id FROM actor
    -> WHERE first_name = 'JENNIFER' AND last_name = 'DAVIS'),
    -> (SELECT film_id FROM film
    -> WHERE title = 'ACE GOLDFINGER'),
    -> now()
    -> );
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.12 sec)
```
