# Data fabrication

- Along with using subqueries to summarize existing data, we can use subqueries to generate data that doesn't exist in any form within our database.
- Let's say we want to sort our customers into the following groups.

| Group name    | Lower Limit | Upper Limit   |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Small Fry     | 0           | $74.99        |
| Average Joes  | $75         | $149.99       |
| Heavy Hitters | $150        | $9,999,999.99 |

- To generate these groups within a single query, we will need a way to define these three groups.
- The first step is to define a query that generates the group definitions.
  - `union all` to merge the results.

```bash
mysql> SELECT 'Small Fry' name, 0 low_limit, 74.99 high_limit
    -> UNION ALL
    -> SELECT 'Average Joes' name, 75 low_limit, 149.99 high_limit
    -> UNION ALL
    -> SELECT 'Heavy Hitters' name, 150 low_limit, 9999999.99 high_limit;
+---------------+-----------+------------+
| name          | low_limit | high_limit |
+---------------+-----------+------------+
| Small Fry     |         0 |      74.99 |
| Average Joes  |        75 |     149.99 |
| Heavy Hitters |       150 | 9999999.99 |
+---------------+-----------+------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```



- We now have a query to generate the desired groups and we can place it into the `from` clause of another query to generate our customer groups.
- The `from` clause contains two subqueries:
  - `pymnt` returns the total number of films rentals and total payments for each customer,
  - `pymnt_grps` generates the three customer groupings.
  - The two subqueries are joined by finding which of the three groups each customer belongs to, and the rows are then grouped by the group name in order to count the number of customers in each group.

```bash
mysql> SELECT pymnt_grps.name, count(*) num_customers
    -> FROM
    -> (SELECT customer_id,
    -> count(*) num_rentals, sum(amount) tot_payments
    -> FROM payment
    -> GROUP BY customer_id
    -> ) pymnt
    -> INNER JOIN
    -> (SELECT 'Small Fry' name, 0 low_limit, 74.99 high_limit
    -> UNION ALL
    -> SELECT 'Average Joes' name, 75 low_limit, 149.99 high_limit
    -> UNION ALL
    -> SELECT 'Heavy Hitters' name, 150 low_limit, 9999999.99 high_limit
    -> ) pymnt_grps
    -> ON pymnt.tot_payments
    -> BETWEEN pymnt_grps.low_limit AND pymnt_grps.high_limit
    -> GROUP BY pymnt_grps.name;
+---------------+---------------+
| name          | num_customers |
+---------------+---------------+
| Average Joes  |           515 |
| Heavy Hitters |            46 |
| Small Fry     |            38 |
+---------------+---------------+
