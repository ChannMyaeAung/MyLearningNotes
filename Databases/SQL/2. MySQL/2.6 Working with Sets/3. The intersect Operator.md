# The intersect Operator

- MySQL 8.0.31 (and later) supports the SQL-standard `INTERSECT` and `INTERSECT ALL`  operators.
- `INTERSECT`  removes duplicates.
- `INTERSECT ALL` returns each common row as many times as it appears in both inputs.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%'
    -> INTERSECT
    -> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' and a.last_name LIKE 'D%';
+------------+-----------+
| first_name | last_name |
+------------+-----------+
| JENNIFER   | DAVIS     |
+------------+-----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%'
    -> INTERSECT ALL
    -> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%';
+------------+-----------+
| first_name | last_name |
+------------+-----------+
| JENNIFER   | DAVIS     |
+------------+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'C%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'A%'
    -> INTERSECT
    -> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'C%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'A%';
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

**Films stocked in both stores, with copy counts**

```bash
mysql> SELECT film_id
    -> FROM inventory
    -> WHERE store_id = 1
    -> INTERSECT ALL
    -> SELECT film_id
    -> FROM inventory
    -> WHERE store_id = 2;
...

|     995 |
|     999 |
|     999 |
|    1000 |
|    1000 |
|    1000 |
|    1000 |
+---------+

```

**Common actors in two films**

```bash
mysql> SELECT actor_id
    -> FROM film_actor
    -> WHERE film_id = 1
    -> INTERSECT ALL
    -> SELECT actor_id
    -> FROM film_actor
    -> WHERE film_id = 2;
Empty set (0.02 sec)
```

**Finding Common First Names Between Actors and Customers**

```bash
mysql> SELECT first_name
    -> FROM actor
    -> WHERE actor_id != 8
    -> INTERSECT
    -> SELECT first_name
    -> FROM customer;
+-------------+
| first_name  |
+-------------+
| JENNIFER    |
| JOHNNY      |
| GRACE       |
| JOE         |
| CHRISTIAN   |

...
...
| DEBBIE      |
| GREGORY     |
| JOHN        |
+-------------+
72 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

**Common Columns in Metadata**

- The query returns column names that are common to both the `actor` and `customer` tables in the Sakila database.

```bash
mysql> SELECT column_name
    -> FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    -> WHERE table_name = 'actor'
    -> INTERSECT
    -> SELECT column_name
    -> FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    -> WHERE table_name = 'customer';
+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME |
+-------------+
| first_name  |
| last_name   |
| last_update |
+-------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

```bash
mysql> SELECT column_name
    -> FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    -> WHERE table_name = 'actor'
    -> INTERSECT ALL
    -> SELECT column_name
    -> FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    -> WHERE table_name = 'customer';
+-------------+
| COLUMN_NAME |
+-------------+
| first_name  |
| last_name   |
| last_update |
