# The union Operator

- `union` and `union all` to combine multiple data sets.
- The difference is
  - `union` sorts the combined set and remove duplicates
  - `union all` does not. The number of rows in the final data set will always equal the sum of the number of rows in the sets being combined.
- The following query returns 799 names, with 599 rows coming from the `customer` table and the other 200 from the `actor` table.
  - The first column has the alias `typ`, which is not necessary but added to show the source of each name returned by the query.

```bash
mysql> SELECT 'CUST' typ, c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> UNION ALL
    -> SELECT 'ACTR' typ, a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a;
...
...
...
| CUST | VIOLA       | HANSON       |
| CUST | COURTNEY    | DAY          |
| CUST | MARIAN      | MENDOZA      |
| CUST | STELLA      | MORENO       |
| CUST | CAROLINE    | BOWMAN       |
...
...
...
| ACTR | BELA        | WALKEN       |
| ACTR | REESE       | WEST         |
| ACTR | MARY        | KEITEL       |
| ACTR | JULIA       | FAWCETT      |
| ACTR | THORA       | TEMPLE       |
+------+-------------+--------------+
799 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- We can see `union all` doesn't remove duplicates in the following output. (200 rows from the `actor` table included twice (400 rows total)).

```bash
mysql> SELECT 'ACTR' type, a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> UNION ALL
    -> SELECT 'ACTR' typ, a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a;
...
...
...
| ACTR | JAYNE       | SILVERSTONE  |
| ACTR | BELA        | WALKEN       |
| ACTR | REESE       | WEST         |
| ACTR | MARY        | KEITEL       |
| ACTR | JULIA       | FAWCETT      |
| ACTR | THORA       | TEMPLE       |
+------+-------------+--------------+
400 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- Another compound query that returns duplicate data.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%'
    -> AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%'
    -> UNION ALL
    -> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%'
    -> AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%';
+------------+-----------+
| first_name | last_name |
+------------+-----------+
| JENNIFER   | DAVIS     |
| JENNIFER   | DAVIS     |
| JUDY       | DEAN      |
| JODIE      | DEGENERES |
| JULIANNE   | DENCH     |
+------------+-----------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

- If we like our combined table to exclude duplicate rows, we need to use `union`.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%'
    -> AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%'
    -> UNION
    -> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%'
    -> AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%';
+------------+-----------+
| first_name | last_name |
+------------+-----------+
| JENNIFER   | DAVIS     |
| JUDY       | DEAN      |
| JODIE      | DEGENERES |
| JULIANNE   | DENCH     |
+------------+-----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
