# Set Operation Rules

## Sorting Compound Query Results

```bash
mysql> SELECT a.first_name fname, a.last_name lname
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%'
    -> UNION ALL
    -> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%'
    -> ORDER BY lname, fname;
+----------+-----------+
| fname    | lname     |
+----------+-----------+
| JENNIFER | DAVIS     |
| JENNIFER | DAVIS     |
| JUDY     | DEAN      |
| JODIE    | DEGENERES |
| JULIANNE | DENCH     |
+----------+-----------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- If we specify column name from the second query in your `order by` clause, we will see the following error.
- Must give the columns in both queries identical column aliases in order to avoid this issue.

```bash
mysql> SELECT a.first_name fname, a.last_name lname
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%'
    -> UNION ALL
    -> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%'
    -> ORDER BY last_name, first_name;
ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'last_name' in 'order clause' 
```

## Set Operation Precedence

- If the compound query contains more than two queries using different set operators, we need to think about **the order in which to place the queries in our compound statement** to achieve the desired results.
- The following compound query includes three queries that return sets of non-unique names.

```bash
mysql> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%'
    -> UNION ALL
    -> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'M%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'T%'
    -> UNION
    -> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%';
+------------+-----------+
| first_name | last_name |
+------------+-----------+
| JENNIFER   | DAVIS     |
| JUDY       | DEAN      |
| JODIE      | DEGENERES |
| JULIANNE   | DENCH     |
| MARY       | TANDY     |
| MENA       | TEMPLE    |
+------------+-----------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- The way `union` and `union all` operators are placed in fact make a difference.
- The following is the same compound query with the set operators reversed.

```bash
mysql> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%'
    -> UNION
    -> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'M%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'T%'
    -> UNION ALL
    -> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%';
+------------+-----------+
| first_name | last_name |
+------------+-----------+
| JENNIFER   | DAVIS     |
| JUDY       | DEAN      |
| JODIE      | DEGENERES |
| JULIANNE   | DENCH     |
| MARY       | TANDY     |
| MENA       | TEMPLE    |
| JENNIFER   | DAVIS     |
+------------+-----------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- In general, compound queries containing three or more queries are evaluated in order from top to bottom but with the following caveats:
  - The ANSI SQL specification calls for the `intersect` operator to have precedence over the other set operators.
  - You may dictate the order in which queries are combined by enclosing multiple queries in parentheses.

```bash
mysql> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%'
    -> UNION
    -> (SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKe 'M%' AND a.last_name LIKe 'T%'
    -> UNION ALL
    -> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKe 'D%');
+------------+-----------+
| first_name | last_name |
+------------+-----------+
| JENNIFER   | DAVIS     |
| JUDY       | DEAN      |
| JODIE      | DEGENERES |
| JULIANNE   | DENCH     |
| MARY       | TANDY     |
| MENA       | TEMPLE    |
+------------+-----------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
