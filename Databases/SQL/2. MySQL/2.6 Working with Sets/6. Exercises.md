6-1. If set A = {L M N O P} and set B = {P Q R S T}, what sets are generated by the following operations?

- `A union B`
- `A union all B`
- `A intersect B`
- `A except B`

Answer:

- `A union B` = {L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T}
- `A union all B` = {L, M, N, O, P, P, Q, R, S, T}
- `A intersect B` = {P}
- `A except B` = {L, M, N, O}

6-2 Write a compound query that finds the first and last names of all actors and customers whose last name starts with L.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.last_name LIKE 'L%'
    -> UNION
    -> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROm actor a
    -> WHERE a.last_name LIKE 'L%';
+------------+--------------+
| first_name | last_name    |
+------------+--------------+

6-3 Sort the results from Exercise 6-2 by the `last_name` column.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.last_name LIKE 'L%'
    -> UNIOn
    -> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.last_name LIKE 'L%'
    -> ORDER BY last_name;
