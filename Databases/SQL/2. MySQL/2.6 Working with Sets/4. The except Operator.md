# The except Operator

- The `except` operator returns the first result set minus any overlap with the second result set.

```bash
mysql> SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name
    -> FROM actor a
    -> WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND a.last_name LIKE 'D%'
    -> EXCEPT
    -> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> FROM customer c
    -> WHERE c.first_name LIKE 'J%' AND c.last_name LIKE 'D%';
+------------+-----------+
| first_name | last_name |
+------------+-----------+
| JUDY       | DEAN      |
| JODIE      | DEGENERES |
| JULIANNE   | DENCH     |
+------------+-----------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

## `except all`

- `except all` removes only one occurrence of duplicate data from set A for every occurrence in set B.

**Example - 1**

Set A - actor_id = 10, 11, 12, 10, 10

Set B - actor_id = 10, 10

A except B = 11, 12

A except all B = 10, 11, 12



**Example - 2**

A = {10, 11, 12, 10, 10, 13, 13, 14}

B = {10, 10, 13}

A except B = {10, 11, 12, 10, 10, 13, 13, 14}  \  {10, 10, 13}  =  {11,12,14}

### `except all` (multiset difference)

- Count occurrences in each multiset:

| Value | count_A | count_B |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| 10    | 3       | 2       |
| 11    | 1       | 0       |
| 12    | 1       | 0       |
| 13    | 2       | 1       |
| 14    | 1       | 0       |

- For each value x, `EXCEPT ALL` yields it `max(count_A(x) - count_B(x), 0)` times:
  - 10 → 3 − 2 = 1
  - 11 → 1 − 0 = 1
  - 12 → 1 − 0 = 1
  - 13 → 2 − 1 = 1
  - 14 → 1 − 0 = 1

```sql
A EXCEPT ALL B  →  10, 11, 12, 13, 14
```
