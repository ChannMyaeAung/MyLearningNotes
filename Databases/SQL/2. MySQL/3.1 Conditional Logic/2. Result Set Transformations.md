# Result Set Transformations

- The following query shows the number of film rentals for May, June, and July of 2005.

```bash
mysql> SELECT monthname(rental_date) rental_month,
    -> count(*) num_rentals
    -> FROM rental
    -> WHERE rental_date BETWEEN '2005-05-01' AND '2005-08-01'
    -> GROUP BY monthname(rental_date);
+--------------+-------------+
| rental_month | num_rentals |
+--------------+-------------+
| May          |        1156 |
| June         |        2311 |
| July         |        6709 |
+--------------+-------------+
3 rows in set (0.08 sec)
```

- But we want a single row of data with three columns (one for each of the three months).
- To transform this result set into a single row, we will need to create three columns and, within each column, sum only those rows pertaining to the month in question.

```bash
mysql> SELECT
    -> SUM(CASE WHEN monthname(rental_date) = 'May'
    -> THEN 1
    -> ELSE 0 END) May_rentals,
    -> SUM(CASE WHEN monthname(rental_date) = 'June'
    -> THEN 1
    -> ELSE 0 END) June_rentals,
    -> SUM(CASE WHEN monthname(rental_date) = 'July'
    -> THEN 1
    -> ELSE 0 END) July_rentals
    -> FROM rental
    -> WHERE rental_date BETWEEN '2005-05-01' AND
    -> '2005-08-01';
+-------------+--------------+--------------+
| May_rentals | June_rentals | July_rentals |
+-------------+--------------+--------------+
|        1156 |         2311 |         6709 |
+-------------+--------------+--------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
