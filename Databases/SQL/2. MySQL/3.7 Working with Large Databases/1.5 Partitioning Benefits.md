# Partitioning Benefits

- We may only need to interact with as few as one partition, rather than the entire table.
- **Partition Pruning**: 
  - If our table is range-partitioned on the `sales_date` column and we execute a query that includes a filter condition such as `WHERE sales_date BETWEEN '2019-12-01' AND '2020-01-15'`, the server will check the tableâ€™s metadata to determine which partitions actually need to be included.
  - One of the biggest advantages of table partitioning.
- **Partition-wise joins**: Executing a query that includes a join to a partitioned table and the query includes a condition on the partitioning column, the server can exclude any partitions that do not contain data pertinent to the query.
- The ability to quickly delete data that is no longer needed for administrators.
