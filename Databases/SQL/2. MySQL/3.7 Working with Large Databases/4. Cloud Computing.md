# Cloud Computing

- With the advent of cloud computing, we can choose to essentially outsource our data center to platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. 
- One of the biggest benefits to hosting our services in the cloud is instant scalability, which allows us to quickly dial up or down the amount of computing power needed to run your services.
- A quick look at AWSâ€™s database and analytics offerings yields the following options:
  - Relational databases (MySQL, Aurora, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server)
  - In-memory database (ElastiCache)
  - Data warehousing database (Redshift)
  - NoSQL database (DynamoDB)
  - Document database (DocumentDB)
  - Graph database (Neptune)
  - Time-series database (TimeStream)
  - Hadoop (EMR)
  - Data lakes (Lake Formation)
