# Big Data

- One way to define the boundaries of big data is with the "3 Vs":
  - Volume: Means billions or trillions of data oints
  - Velocity: A measure of how quickly data arrives.
  - Variety: Means that data is not always structured (as in rows and columns in a relational database) but can also be unstructured (e.g., emails, videos, photos, audio files, etc.).

## Hadoop

- Best described as an ecosystem, or a set of technologies and tools that work together.
- Major components of Hadoop includes:
  - **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)**: Like the name implies, HDFS enables file management across a large number of servers.
  - **MapReduce**: This technology processes large amounts of structured and unstructured data by breaking a task into many small pieces that can be run in parallel across many servers.
  - **YARN**: This is a resource manager and job scheduler for HDFS.
- Together, these technologies allow for the storage and processing of files across hundreds or even thousands of servers acting as a single logical system.
