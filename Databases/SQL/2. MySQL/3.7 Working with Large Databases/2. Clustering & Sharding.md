# Clustering

- What happens if we need to handle thousands of concurrent users or generate tens of thousands of reports during a nightly cycle? 
  - Even if we have sufficient data storage, we may not have enough CPU, memory, or network bandwidth within a single server. 
  - One potential answer is *clustering*, which allows multiple servers to act as a single database.
- Shared-disk/shared-cache configurations, where every server in the cluster has access to all disks, and data cached in one server can be accessed by any other server in the cluster. 
- With this type of architecture, an application server could attach to any one of the database servers in the cluster, with connections automatically failing over to another server in the cluster in case of failure. 
- With an eight-server cluster, we should be able to handle a very large number of concurrent users and associated queries/reports/jobs.

## Sharding

- Sharding partitions the data across multiple databases (called shards).
- Similar to table partitioning but on a larger scale and with far more complexity.
- If we were to employ this strategy for the social media company, we might decide to implement 100 separate databases, each one hosting the data for approximately 10 million users.

| **Clustering** | Run *copies* of the same dataset across multiple nodes that coordinate to look like one database. | **High availability** (fail‑over), read scaling, hot backups. |
| **Sharding**   | **Split** one logical dataset into non‑overlapping *slices* (shards) that live on different nodes. | **Write & storage scaling** when a single box can’t hold or sustain the workload. |
