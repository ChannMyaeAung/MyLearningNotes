# Partitioning Concepts

- When a table is partitioned, two or more table partitions are created, each having the exact same definition but with nonoverlapping subsets of data.
- Once a table has been partitioned, the table itself becomes a virtual concept; the partitions hold the data, and any indexes are built on the data in the partitions.

## Table Partitioning

- The partitioning scheme available in most relational databases is *horizontal partitioning*, which assigns entire rows to exactly one partition.
- When partitioning a table horizontally, we must choose a *partition key*, which is the column whose values are used to assign a row to a particular partition.
- In most cases, a tableâ€™s partition key consists of a single column, and a *partitioning function* is applied to this column to determine in which partition each row should reside.
