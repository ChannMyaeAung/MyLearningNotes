# Counting Distinct Values

- When using `count()`, we can choose to 
  - count all members in the group OR
  - counting only the distinct values for a column across all members of the group.
- By specifying `distinct`, the `count()` examines the values of a column for each member of the group in order to find and remove duplicates, 
  - rather than simply counting the number of values in the group.

```bash
mysql> SELECT COUNT(customer_id) num_rows,
    -> COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) num_customers
    -> FROM payment;
+----------+---------------+
| num_rows | num_customers |
+----------+---------------+
|    16044 |           599 |
+----------+---------------+
1 row in set (0.03 sec)
```

- The first column in the query counts the number of rows in the `payment` table.
- The 2nd column examines the values in the `customer_id` column and counts only the number of unique values.

## Using Expressions

- We may sometimes want to find the maximum number of days between when a film was rented and subsequently returned.

```bash
mysql> SELECT MAX(datediff(return_date, rental_date))
    -> FROM rental;
+-----------------------------------------+
| MAX(datediff(return_date, rental_date)) |
+-----------------------------------------+
|                                      10 |
+-----------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)
```
