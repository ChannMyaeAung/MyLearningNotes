# Generating Rollups

- Let's say along with the total count for each actor/rating combination, we also want total counts for each distinct actor.
- `with rollup` option to have the database server do the work for us.

```bash
mysql> SELECT fa.actor_id, f.rating, count(*)
    -> FROM film_actor fa
    -> INNER JOIN film f
    -> ON fa.film_id = f.film_id
    -> GROUP BY fa.actor_id, f.rating WITH ROLLUP
    -> ORDER BY 1,2;
