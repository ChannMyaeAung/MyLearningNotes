# Generating Rollups

- Let's say along with the total count for each actor/rating combination, we also want total counts for each distinct actor.
- `with rollup` option to have the database server do the work for us.
- When to use `WITH ROLLUP`:
  - **Financial reports**: subtotals per account/category and grand totals.
  - **Sales dashboards**: totals by region → country → all.
  - **Any hierarchical grouping**: where we want both detailed rows and their aggregates in one result.

```bash
mysql> SELECT fa.actor_id, f.rating, count(*)
    -> FROM film_actor fa
    -> INNER JOIN film f
    -> ON fa.film_id = f.film_id
    -> GROUP BY fa.actor_id, f.rating WITH ROLLUP
    -> ORDER BY 1,2;

- For the 200 actor rollups, a `null` value is provided for the `rating` column, since the rollup is being performed across all ratings.
- The first line for `actor_id 200`, a total of 20 films are associated with the actor:
  - 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 6.
