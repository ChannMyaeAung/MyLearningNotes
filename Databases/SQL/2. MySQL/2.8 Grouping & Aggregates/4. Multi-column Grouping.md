# Multi-column Grouping

- Let's say we want to find the total number of films for each film rating for each actor.

```bash
mysql> SELECT fa.actor_id, f.rating, count(*)
    -> FROM film_actor fa
    -> INNER JOIN film f
    -> ON fa.film_id = f.film_id
    -> GROUP BY fa.actor_id, f.rating
    -> ORDER BY 1,2;
...

|      199 | NC-17  |        2 |
|      200 | G      |        5 |
|      200 | PG     |        3 |
|      200 | PG-13  |        2 |
|      200 | R      |        6 |
|      200 | NC-17  |        4 |

996 rows in set (0.08 sec)
```

- The query generates 996 groups, one for each combination of actor and film rating found
  - by joining the two tables.
