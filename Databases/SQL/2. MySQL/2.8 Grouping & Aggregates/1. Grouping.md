# Grouping

- Sometimes we will want to find trends in our data.
- For instance, sending coupons for free rentals to our best customers.
- We can ask the database server to group the data for us by using the `group by` clause.

## Example

- The aggregate function `count()` counts the number of rows in each group, and the asterisk tells the server to count everything in the group.
- The  combination of `group by` and `count()` can generate exactly the data needed to answer the business question without having to look at the raw data.
- The results below are sorted, we can easily see that customer ID 148 has rented the most films (46) while customer ID 318 has rented the fewest films (12).

```bash
mysql> SELECT customer_id, count(*)
    -> FROM rental
    -> GROUP BY customer_id
    -> ORDER BY 2 DESC;
+-------------+----------+
| customer_id | count(*) |
+-------------+----------+
|         148 |       46 |
|         526 |       45 |
|         144 |       42 |
|         236 |       42 |
|          75 |       41 |
|         197 |       40 |
|         469 |       40 |
...
...
...
|         248 |       15 |
|          61 |       14 |
|         110 |       14 |
|         281 |       14 |
|         318 |       12 |
+-------------+----------+
599 rows in set (0.08 sec)
```

- When grouping data, we may need to filter out undesired data from our result set based on groups of data rather than based on the raw data.

```bash
mysql> SELECT customer_id, count(*)
    -> FROM rental
    -> WHERE count(*) >= 40
    -> GROUP BY customer_id;
ERROR 1111 (HY000): Invalid use of group function
```

- We cannot refer to the aggregate function `count(*)` in our where clause, 
  - because the groups have not yet been generated at the time the `where` clause is evaluated.
- We must put our group filter conditions in the `having` clause.

```bash
mysql> SELECT customer_id, count(*)
    -> FROM rental
    -> GROUP BY customer_id
    -> HAVING count(*) >= 40;
+-------------+----------+
| customer_id | count(*) |
+-------------+----------+
|          75 |       41 |
|         144 |       42 |
|         148 |       46 |
|         197 |       40 |
|         236 |       42 |
|         469 |       40 |
|         526 |       45 |
+-------------+----------+
