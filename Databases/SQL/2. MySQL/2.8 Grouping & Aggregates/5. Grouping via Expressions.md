# Grouping via Expressions

- Along with using columns to group data, we can build groups based on the values generated by expressions.
- The following query uses the `extract()` to return only the year portion of a date to group the rows in the `rental` table.

```bash
mysql> SELECT extract(YEAR FROM rental_date) year,
    -> COUNT(*) how_many
    -> FROM rental
    -> GROUP BY extract(YEAR FROM rental_date);
+------+----------+
| year | how_many |
+------+----------+
| 2005 |    15862 |
| 2006 |      182 |
+------+----------+
2 rows in set (0.03 sec)
```
