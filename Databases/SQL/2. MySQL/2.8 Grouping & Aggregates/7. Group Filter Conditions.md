# Group Filter Conditions

- The following query has two filter conditions,
  - one in the `where` clause, which filters out any films rated something other than G or PG.
  - another in the `having` clause, which filters out any actors who appeared in less than 10 films.

```bash
mysql> SELECT fa.actor_id, f.rating, count(*)
    -> FROM film_actor fa
    -> INNER JOIN film f
    -> ON fa.film_id = f.film_id
    -> WHERE f.rating IN ('G', 'PG')
    -> GROUP BY fa.actor_id, f.rating
    -> HAVING count(*) > 9;
+----------+--------+----------+
| actor_id | rating | count(*) |
+----------+--------+----------+
|      137 | PG     |       10 |
|       37 | PG     |       12 |
|      180 | PG     |       12 |
|        7 | G      |       10 |
|       83 | G      |       14 |
|      129 | G      |       12 |
|      111 | PG     |       15 |
|       44 | PG     |       12 |
|       26 | PG     |       11 |
|       92 | PG     |       12 |
|       17 | G      |       12 |
|      158 | PG     |       10 |
|      147 | PG     |       10 |
|       14 | G      |       10 |
|      102 | PG     |       11 |
|      133 | PG     |       10 |

- One of the filters acts on data before it is grouped, and the other filter acts on data after the groups have been created.
- If we mistakenly put both filters in the `where` clause,

```bash
mysql> SELECT fa.actor_id, f.rating, count(*)
    -> FROM film_actor fa
    -> INNER JOIN film f
    -> ON fa.film_id = f.film_id
    -> WHERE f.rating IN ('G', 'PG')
    -> AND count(*) > 9
    -> GROUP BY fa.actor_id, f.rating;
ERROR 1111 (HY000): Invalid use of group function
```

- It fails because we cannot include an aggregate function in a query's `where` clause.
- This is because the filters in the `where` clause are evaluated before the grouping occurs, so the server can't yet perform any functions on groups.
