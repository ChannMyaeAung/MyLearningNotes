# Multicolumn indexes

- If we find ourselves searching for customers by first and last names, we can build an index on both columns together:

```bash
mysql> ALTER TABLE customer
    -> ADD INDEX idx_full_name(last_name, first_name);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.65 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

- This index will be useful for queries that specify the first and last names or just the last name, but it would not be useful for queries that specify only the customer's first name.
- Thus we should think carefully about which column to list first and which to list second.
