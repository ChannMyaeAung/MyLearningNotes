# Types of indexes

1. **B-Tree indexes:**

   - A height-balanced tree (AVL/B-tree) where each node holds key values and pointers to child nodes or row locations.
   - Default for InnoDB, MyISAM, etc., whenever we declare an `INDEX`, `PRIMARY KEY`, or `UNIQUE` (unless it’s `FULLTEXT` or `SPATIAL`).
   - **Strengths:**
     - Excellent for **equality** (`=`) and **range** queries (`<`, `>`, `BETWEEN`),
     - Supports **prefix** lookups on string columns (`LIKE 'abc%'`),
     - Composite indexes obey the **left-most-prefix** rule.
   - **When to Use:** Almost any OLTP workload where fast lookups or ordered scans are needed.

   

2. **Bitmap indexes:**

   - For each distinct column value, store a **bit-vector** whose bits mark which rows have that value.
   - For columns that contain only a small number of values across a large number of rows (known as *low-cardinality* data), a different indexing strategy is needed.
     - `customer.active` has only two different values 1 and 0, and because there are far more active customers, it can be difficult to maintain a balanced B-tree index as the number of customers grows.
   - **MySQL Support:** **Not natively** supported in core InnoDB/MyISAM (we’ll see them in data-warehousing engines like Oracle or specialized columnar stores).
   - **Strengths:**
     - Extremely compact for **low-cardinality** columns (e.g. gender, status flags),
     - Very fast for Boolean combinations (`AND`/`OR`) because bitwise operations are cheap.
   - **Limitations:**
     - **Poor** update performance—every `INSERT`/`UPDATE` must rewrite bitmaps,
     - Rarely used in high-update OLTP systems.
   - **When to Use:** In read-heavy, analytical environments or columnar stores. MySQL users typically emulate some bitmap behavior via summary tables or external search engines.

3. **Text (Full-Text) Indexes:**

   - An **inverted index** mapping each distinct word/token → list of row IDs where it appears.
   - **MySQL Support:**
     - `FULLTEXT` indexes in InnoDB (since 5.6) and MyISAM.
     - Query with `MATCH(column) AGAINST('search terms' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE)` or boolean mode.
   - **Strengths:**
     - Designed for **natural-language** searches: ranking by relevance, stop-word filtering, stemming.
   - **Limitations:**
     - Not great for prefix or wildcard searches (use B-Tree for `LIKE 'foo%'`).
     - Requires a minimum word length and has a default stop-word list.
   - **When to Use:** Anytime we need built-in full-text search capabilities over large text columns.
