# The Downside of Indexes

- Every index is a table, thus every time a row is added to or removed from a table, all indexes on that table must be modified.
- When a row is updated, any indexes on the column or columns that were affected need to be modified as well.
- Therefore, the more indexes we have, the more work the server needs to do to keep all schema objects up-to-date, which tends to slow things down.
- Indexes also require disk space as well as some amount of care from the administrators, so the best strategy is to add an index when a clear need arises.
- In general, we should strive to have neither too many indexes nor too few.
- Indexing strategies:
  - Make sure all primary key columns are indexed (most servers automatically create unique indexes when we create primary key constraints).
  - For multicolumn primary keys, consider building additional indexes on a subset of the primary key columns 
    - or on all the primary key columns but in a different order than the primary key constraint definition.
  - Build indexes on all columns that are referenced in foreign key constraints.
  - Index any columns that will frequently be used to retrieve data. 
    - Most date columns are good candidates, along with short (2- to 50-character) string columns.
