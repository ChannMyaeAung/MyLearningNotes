# Constraints

- A restriction placed on one or more columns of a table.
- Types of constraints:
  - **Primary key constraints**: Identify the column or columns that guarantee uniqueness within a table
  - **Foreign key constraints**: Restrict one or more columns to contain only values found in another table's primary key columns.
  - **Unique constraints**: Restrict one or more columns to contain unique values within a table (primary key constraints are a special type of unique constraint).
  - **Check constraints**: Restrict the allowable values for a column.
- **Orphaned Rows**: a data that no longer points to a valid record.
  - E.g., If the server allows us to change a customerâ€™s ID in the `customer` table without changing the same customer ID in the `rental` table, then we will end up with rental data that no longer points to valid customer records.
