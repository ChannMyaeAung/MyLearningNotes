# Unique indexes

- It's allowable to have two customers named John Smith in the `customer` table since each row will have a different identifier (`customer_id`), email, and address to help tell them apart.
- We would not want to allow two different customers to have the same email address.
- We can enforce a rule against duplicate values by creating a unique index on the `customer.email` column.
- Whenever a row is inserted or when the indexed column is modified, the database server checks the unique index to see whether the value already exists in another row in the table.

```bash
mysql> ALTER TABLE customer
    -> ADD UNIQUE idx_email (email);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.61 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

- With the index in place, we will receive an error if we try to add a new customer with an email address that already exists.

```bash
mysql> INSERT INTO customer
    -> (store_id, first_name, last_name, email,
    -> address_id, active)
    -> VALUES
    -> (1, 'ALAN', 'KAHN', 'ALAN.KAHN@sakilacustomer.org', 394, 1);
ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry 'ALAN.KAHN@sakilacustomer.org' for key 'customer.idx_email'
```

- We should not build unique indexes on our primary key column(s), since the server already checks uniqueness for primary key values.
- We may however, create more than one unique index on the same table.
