# How Indexes Are Used

- Indexes are generally used by the server to quickly locate rows in a particular table, 
  - after which the server visits the associated table to extract the additional information requested by the user.

```bash
mysql> SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE first_name LIKE 'S%' AND last_name LIKE 'P%';
+-------------+------------+-----------+
| customer_id | first_name | last_name |
+-------------+------------+-----------+
|          84 | SARA       | PERRY     |
|         197 | SUE        | PETERS    |
|         167 | SALLY      | PIERCE    |
+-------------+------------+-----------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- To see how MySQL's query optimizer decides to execute the query, `explain` to ask the server to show the execution plan for the query rather than executing the query.

```bash
mysql> EXPLAIN
    -> SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE first_name LIKE 'S%' AND last_name LIKE 'P%' \G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: customer
   partitions: NULL
         type: range
possible_keys: idx_last_name,idx_full_name
          key: idx_full_name
      key_len: 364
          ref: NULL
         rows: 28
     filtered: 11.11
        Extra: Using where; Using index
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.02 sec)
```

- Looking at the query results, the `possible_keys` column tells us that the server could decide to use either the `idx_last_name` or the `idx_full_name` index, 
- And the `key` column tells us that the `idx_full_name` index was chosen. 
- Furthermore, the `type` column tells us that a range scan will be utilized, meaning that the database server will be looking for a range of values in the index, rather than expecting to retrieve a single row.
