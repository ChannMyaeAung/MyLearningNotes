    -> ADD CONSTRAINT fk_rental_customer_id
    -> FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
    -> REFERENCES customer (customer_id)
    -> ON DELETE RESTRICT;
Query OK, 16044 rows affected (6.92 sec)
Records: 16044  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

```mysql
SELECT customer_id, payment_date, amount
FROM payment
WHERE payment_date > cast('2019-12-31 23:59:59' as datetime);

SELECT customer_id, payment_date, amount
FROM payment
â€‹WHERE payment_date > cast('2019-12-31 23:59:59' as datetime)
  AND amount < 5;
```

**ANS:**

```bash
mysql> ALTER TABLE payment
    -> ADD INDEX idx_payment_date_amount (payment_date, amount);
