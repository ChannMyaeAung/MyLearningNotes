# Natural Joins

- We can let the database server determine what the join conditions need to be, known as the **natural join**.
- Relies on identical column names across multiple tables to infer the proper join conditions.
- E.g. the `rental` table includes a column named `customer_id` which is the foreign key to the `customer` table, whose primary key is also named `customer_id`.
- Thus we could try to write a query that uses `natural join` to join the two tables.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, date(r.rental_date)
    -> FROM customer c
    -> NATURAL JOIN rental r;
Empty set (0.10 sec)
```

- Because we specified a natural join, the server inspected the table definitions and added the join condition `r.customer_id = c.customer_id` to join the two tables.
- But in sakila schema, all of the tables include the column `last_update` to show when each row was last modified, so the server is also adding the join condition `r.last_update = c.last_update`, which causes the query to return no data.
- We can use a sub-query to restrict the columns for at least one of the tables.

```mysql
SELECT cust.first_name, cust.last_name, date(r.rental_date)
FROM
    (SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
     FROM customer) cust
NATURAL JOIN rental r;
```

**Note**: we should avoid this join type and use inner joins with explicit join conditions.
