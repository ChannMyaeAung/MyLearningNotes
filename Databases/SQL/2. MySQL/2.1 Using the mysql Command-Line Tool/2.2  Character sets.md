# Character sets

- Languages which contain large number of characters (e.g. Japanese and Korean), require multiple bytes of storage for each character.
  - Such character sets are called **multibyte character sets**.

```bash
mysql> SHOW CHARACTER SET;
+----------+---------------------------------+---------------------+--------+
| Charset  | Description                     | Default collation   | Maxlen |
+----------+---------------------------------+---------------------+--------+
| armscii8 | ARMSCII-8 Armenian              | armscii8_general_ci |      1 |
| ascii    | US ASCII                        | ascii_general_ci    |      1 |
| big5     | Big5 Traditional Chinese        | big5_chinese_ci     |      2 |
...

41 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- If the value in the fourth column, `Maxlen` is greater than 1, then the character set is a multi-byte character set.
