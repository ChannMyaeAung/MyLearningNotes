# Using the mysql Command-Line Tool 

- If we are logging in using the root account, we would do:

```bash
mysql -u root -p;
```

- After typing in the password, we will see the `mysql>` prompt.

```bash
mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sakila             |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- Since we will be using the Sakila database, we will need to specify the database we want to wrok with via the `use` command.

```bash
mysql> use sakila;
Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Database changed
```

- Whenever we invoke the `mysql` CLI, we can specify both the username and database to use.

```bash
mysql -u root -p sakila;
```

- If we want to know the current date and time:

```bash
mysql> SELECT now();
+---------------------+
| now()               |
+---------------------+
| 2025-06-18 16:27:04 |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

- We can type `quit;` or `exit;` to return to the Unix or Windows command shell.
