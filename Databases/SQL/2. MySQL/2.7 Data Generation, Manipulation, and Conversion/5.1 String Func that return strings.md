# String functions that return strings

- First resetting our `string_tbl` table.

```bash
mysql> DELETE FROM string_tbl;
Query OK, 5 rows affected (0.09 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO string_tbl (text_fld)
    -> VALUES ('This string was 29 characters');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.10 sec)
```



## Concat()

- The following query (uses `concat()`) to modify the string stored in the `text_fld` column by tracking an additional phrase on the end.
- Like all functions that return a string, we can use `concat()` to replace the data stored in a character column.

```bash
mysql> UPDATE string_tbl
    -> SET text_fld = CONCAT(text_fld, ', but now it is longer');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.07 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT text_fld
    -> FROM string_tbl;
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| text_fld                                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| This string was 29 characters, but now it is longer |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

- Another use is to build a string from individual pieces of data.
- The following query generates a narrative of string for each customer.
  - `concat()` can handle any expression that returns a string and will even convert numbers and date to string format.

```bash
mysql> SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name,
    -> ' has been a customer since ',
    -> date(create_date)) cust_narrative
    -> FROM customer;
...
...
...
| TERRANCE ROUSH has been a customer since 2006-02-14        |
| RENE MCALISTER has been a customer since 2006-02-14        |
| EDUARDO HIATT has been a customer since 2006-02-14         |
| TERRENCE GUNDERSON has been a customer since 2006-02-14    |
| ENRIQUE FORSYTHE has been a customer since 2006-02-14      |
| FREDDIE DUGGAN has been a customer since 2006-02-14        |
| WADE DELVALLE has been a customer since 2006-02-14         |
| AUSTIN CINTRON has been a customer since 2006-02-14        |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
599 rows in set (0.01 sec)

## Insert()

- `concat()` is useful for adding chars to the beginning or end of string, but if we want to add or replace chars in the middle of a string:
- MySQL includes the `insert()` function:
  - 1st arg: the original string
  - 2nd arg: the position at which to start
  - 3rd arg: the number of characters to replace
  - 4th arg: the replacement string
- Depending on the value of the 3rd arg, the function may be used to either insert or replace characters in a string.
  - 0 value for 3rd arg: the replacement string is inserted and any trailing characters are pushed to the right.
- In the following query, all characters starting from position 9 are pushed to the right, and the string `cruel` is inserted.

```bash
mysql> SELECT INSERT('goodbye world', 9, 0, 'cruel ') string;
+---------------------+
| string              |
+---------------------+
| goodbye cruel world |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

- But if the 3rd arg is greater than zero, then that number of characters is replaced with the replacement string.
- The following query replaces `goodbye` with `hello`. We start from 1st position and the 3rd arg is 7. So 7 number of chars is `goodbye` which is replaced with `hello`.

```bash
mysql> SELECT INSERT('goodbye world', 1, 7, 'hello') string;
+-------------+
| string      |
+-------------+
| hello world |
+-------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```



## Replace()

- Provides the same functionality as `insert()`.
  - 1st arg: original string
  - 2nd arg: search string
  - 3rd arg: replacement string

```bash
mysql> SELECT REPLACE('goodbye world', 'goodbye', 'hello')
    -> FROM dual;
+----------------------------------------------+
| REPLACE('goodbye world', 'goodbye', 'hello') |
+----------------------------------------------+
| hello world                                  |
+----------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```



## substring()

- Extracts a specified number of characters starting at a specified position.
- The following query extracts five characters from a string starting at the 9th position.

```bash
mysql> SELECT SUBSTRING('goodbye cruel world', 9, 5);
+----------------------------------------+
| SUBSTRING('goodbye cruel world', 9, 5) |
+----------------------------------------+
| cruel                                  |
+----------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
