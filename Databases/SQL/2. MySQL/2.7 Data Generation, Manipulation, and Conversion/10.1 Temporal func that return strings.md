# Temporal functions that return strings

- Most of the temporal functions that return string values are used to extract a portion of a date or time.
- `dayname()` to determine which day of the week a certain date falls on.

```bash
mysql> SELECT DAYNAME('2025-07-01');
+-----------------------+
| DAYNAME('2025-07-01') |
+-----------------------+
| Tuesday               |
+-----------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

- The `extract()` function uses the same interval types as the `date_add()` .
- The `extract()` has been implemented by Oracle Database as well as MySQL.
- The following query extract just the year portion of a `datetime` value.

````bash
mysql> SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM '2019-09-18 22:19:05');
+------------------------------------------+
| EXTRACT(YEAR FROM '2019-09-18 22:19:05') |
+------------------------------------------+
|                                     2019 |
+------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
