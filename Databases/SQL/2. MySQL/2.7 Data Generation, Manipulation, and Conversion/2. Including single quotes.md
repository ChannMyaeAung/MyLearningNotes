# Including single quotes

```bash
mysql> UDPATE string_tbl
    -> SET text_fld = 'This string doesn't work';
    '>
```

- To make the server ignore the apostrophe in the word `doesn't`, we will need to add an escape to the string so it treats it like any other chars.

```bash
mysql> UPDATE string_tbl
    -> SET text_fld = 'This string didn''t work, but it does now';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.10 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
```

- Oracle and MySQL users may choose to add a backslash as well for the same result.

```bash
mysql> UPDATE string_tbl
    -> SET text_fld = 'This string didn\'t work, but it does now';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 0  Warnings: 0
```

```bash
mysql> SELECT text_fld
    -> FROM string_tbl;
+------------------------------------------+
| text_fld                                 |
+------------------------------------------+
| This string didn't work, but it does now |
+------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```



**If we are retrieving the string to add to a file that another program will read:**

- We can use the built-in function `quote()`.
- `quote()` places quotes around the entire string and adds escapes to any single quotes/apostrophes within the string.

```bash
mysql> SELECT quote(text_fld)
    -> FROM string_tbl;
+---------------------------------------------+
| quote(text_fld)                             |
+---------------------------------------------+
| 'This string didn\'t work, but it does now' |
+---------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
