# Lag and Lead

- Along with computing sums and averages over a data window, another common reporting task involves comparing values from one row to another.
- E.g., When generating monthly sales totals, we may be asked to create a column showing the percentage difference from the prior month, 
  - which will require a way to retrieve the monthly sales total from the previous row. 
- This can be accomplished using the `lag` function, which will retrieve a column value from a prior row in the result set, or the `lead` function, which will retrieve a column value from a following row.
  - Both `lag` and `lead` allow for an optional second parameter (which defaults to 1) to describe the number of rows prior/following from which to retrieve the column value.

```bash
mysql> SELECT yearweek(payment_date) payment_week,
    -> sum(amount) week_total,
    -> lag(sum(amount), 1)
    -> over (order by yearweek(payment_date)) prev_wk_tot,
    -> lead(sum(amount), 1)
    -> over (order by yearweek(payment_date)) next_wk_tot
    -> FROM payment
    -> GROUP BY yearweek(payment_date)
    -> ORDER BY 1;
+--------------+------------+-------------+-------------+
| payment_week | week_total | prev_wk_tot | next_wk_tot |
+--------------+------------+-------------+-------------+
|       200521 |    2846.19 |        NULL |     1977.25 |
|       200522 |    1977.25 |     2846.19 |     5603.43 |
|       200524 |    5603.43 |     1977.25 |     4026.46 |
|       200525 |    4026.46 |     5603.43 |     8490.83 |

- Here’s how we could use the `lag` function to generate the percentage difference from the prior week:
  - In this following query, the window definition `over (order by yearweek(payment_date))`.
    - **Partition**: not specified, so the entire result set is one partition.
    - **Order**: chronological by `payment_week`, ensuring “previous row” really is the previous week in time.
    - **Frame**: default `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`; with `LAG` that means “look exactly one row earlier.”

```bash
mysql> SELECT yearweek(payment_date) payment_week,
    -> sum(amount) week_total,
    -> round((sum(amount) - lag(sum(amount), 1)
    -> over (order by yearweek(payment_date)))
    -> / lag(sum(amount), 1)
    -> over (order by yearweek(payment_date))
    -> * 100, 1) pct_diff
    -> FROM payment
    -> GROUP BY yearweek(payment_date)
    -> ORDER BY 1;
+--------------+------------+----------+
| payment_week | week_total | pct_diff |
+--------------+------------+----------+
|       200521 |    2846.19 |     NULL |
|       200522 |    1977.25 |    -30.5 |
|       200524 |    5603.43 |    183.4 |
