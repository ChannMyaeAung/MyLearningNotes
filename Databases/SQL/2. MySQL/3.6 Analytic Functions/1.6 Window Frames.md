# Window Frames

- Say we want to generate a running total starting from the beginning of the year up to the current row. 
- For these types of calculations, you can include a “frame” subclause to define exactly which rows to include in the data window. Here’s a query that sums payments for each week and includes a reporting function to calculate the rolling sum:
  - The `rolling_sum` column expression includes the `rows unbounded preceding` subclause to define a data window from the beginning of the result set up to and including the current row.

```bash
mysql> SELECT yearweek(payment_date) payment_week,
    -> sum(amount) week_total,
    -> sum(sum(amount))
    -> over (order by yearweek(payment_date)
    -> rows unbounded preceding) rolling_sum
    -> FROM payment
    -> GROUP BY yearweek(payment_date)
    -> ORDER BY 1;
+--------------+------------+-------------+
| payment_week | week_total | rolling_sum |
+--------------+------------+-------------+
|       200521 |    2846.19 |     2846.19 |
|       200522 |    1977.25 |     4823.44 |
|       200524 |    5603.43 |    10426.87 |
|       200525 |    4026.46 |    14453.33 |

- Along with rolling sums, we can calculate rolling averages. 
- The following query calculates a three-week rolling average of total payments:
  - The `rolling_3wk_avg` column defines a data window consisting of the current row, the prior row, and the next row.

```bash
mysql> SELECT yearweek(payment_date) payment_week,
    -> sum(amount) week_total,
    -> avg(sum(amount))
    -> over (order by yearweek(payment_date)
    -> rows between 1 preceding and 1 following) rolling_3wk_avg
    -> FROM payment
    -> GROUP BY yearweek(payment_date)
    -> ORDER BY 1;
+--------------+------------+-----------------+
| payment_week | week_total | rolling_3wk_avg |
+--------------+------------+-----------------+
