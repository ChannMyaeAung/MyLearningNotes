# Data Windows

- The following query sums up the total monthly payments for film rentals for the period May thru August 2005.

```bash 
mysql> SELECT quarter(payment_date) quarter,
    -> monthname(payment_date) month_nm,
    -> sum(amount) monthly_sales
    -> FROM payment
    -> WHERE year(payment_date) = 2005
    -> GROUP BY quarter(payment_date), monthname(payment_date);
+---------+----------+---------------+
| quarter | month_nm | monthly_sales |
+---------+----------+---------------+
|       2 | May      |       4823.44 |
|       2 | June     |       9629.89 |
|       3 | July     |      28368.91 |
|       3 | August   |      24070.14 |

- July had the highest monthly total across all four months.
- In order to determine the highest values programmatically, we will need to add additional columns to each row showing the maximum values per quarter and over the entire period.
- The new query is the previous query but with two new columns to calculate these values.
- `OVER ()` means "across all result rows."
- **`PARTITION BY quarter`** splits the four rows into two sub‑windows:
  - Quarter 2: rows for May and June
  - Quarter 3: rows for July and August
- The single highest monthly_sales across all months in 2005:
  -  `MAX(SUM(amount))     OVER ()                      AS max_overall_sales`.
- The highest monthly_sales _within_ each quarter:
   `MAX(SUM(amount))     OVER (
      PARTITION BY QUARTER(payment_date)
    )`

```bash
mysql> SELECT quarter(payment_date) quarter,
    -> monthname(payment_date) month_nm,
    -> sum(amount) monthly_sales,
    -> max(sum(amount))
    -> over () max_overall_sales,
    -> max(sum(amount))
    -> over (partition by quarter(payment_date)) max_qrtr_sales
    -> FROM payment
    -> WHERE year(payment_date) = 2005
    -> GROUP BY quarter(payment_date), monthname(payment_date);
+---------+----------+---------------+-------------------+----------------+
| quarter | month_nm | monthly_sales | max_overall_sales | max_qrtr_sales |
+---------+----------+---------------+-------------------+----------------+
|       2 | May      |       4823.44 |          28368.91 |        9629.89 |
|       2 | June     |       9629.89 |          28368.91 |        9629.89 |
|       3 | July     |      28368.91 |          28368.91 |       28368.91 |
|       3 | August   |      24070.14 |          28368.91 |       28368.91 |
+---------+----------+---------------+-------------------+----------------+

- Within each partition, it finds the maximum `monthly_sales`.
  - For Q2: `MAX(4823.44, 9629.89)` → **9629.89**
  - For Q3: `MAX(28368.91, 24070.14)` → **28368.91**
- Windows are defined using the `over` clause combined with an optional `partition by` subclause.
