# Analytic Function Concepts

- Once the base query has finished joining, filtering, grouping, and sorting, the **entire result set** sits in memory as a table of rows.

- **Analytic functions** let us “walk” that in-memory table and compute values **across rows** without collapsing them:

  - **Rankings** (e.g. `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`) to order salespeople or regions by performance.
  - **Percent differences** between current and prior periods (e.g. `((this_month–last_month)/last_month)*100`).
  - **Running totals** or **moving averages** (e.g. cumulative sales, 7‑day rolling average).
  - **Subtotals** for each logical section (using `GROUP BY … WITH ROLLUP` or windowed `SUM() OVER (PARTITION…)`).
  - A **grand total** across all rows (e.g. bottom‑of‑report summary via a window that spans the full set).

  They rely on three key clauses:

  1. **`PARTITION BY`** to divide the rows into independent groups (e.g. per region).
  2. **`ORDER BY`** within each partition to define the sequence (e.g. by date).
  3. **Window frame** definitions (e.g. `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`) to control which neighboring rows feed each calculation.

- We get rich, row‑aware metrics **and** still see every detail row

  - no separate aggregation step or multiple passes needed.
