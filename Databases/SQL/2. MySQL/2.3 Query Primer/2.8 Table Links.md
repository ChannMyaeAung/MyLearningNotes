# Table Links

- We are linking the two tables (customer and rental tables) using `join` clause.
- The database server is instructed to use the value of the `customer_id` column in the `customer` table to find all of the customer's rentals in the `rental` table.
- The `where ` clause below is not part of the join and is only included to keep the result set fairly small.

```bash
mysql> SELECT customer.first_name, customer.last_name,
    -> time(rental.rental_date) rental_time
    -> FROM customer
    -> INNER JOIN rental
    -> ON customer.customer_id = rental.customer_id
    -> WHERE date(rental.rental_date) = '2005-06-14';
