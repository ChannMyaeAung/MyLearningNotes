# Views (Virtual Table)

- A query that is stored in the data dictionary.
- Looks and acts like a table but there's no data associated with a view.
- When issuing a query against a view, our query is merged with the view definition to create a final query to be executed.
- Views are created for various reasons, including to hide columns from users and to simplify complex database designs.

```bash
mysql> CREATE VIEW cust_vw AS
    -> SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, active
    -> FROM customer;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.25 sec)
```

- When the view is created, no additional data is generated or stored.
  - but pulls from the underlying table (`customer`) whenever we query it.

```bash
mysql> SELECT first_name, last_name
    -> FROM cust_vw
    -> WHERE active = 0;
