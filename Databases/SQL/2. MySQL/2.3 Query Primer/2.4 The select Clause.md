# The select Clause

- We can spice things up in our `select` clause by including things such as:
  - Literals, such as numbers or strings
  - Expressions, such as `transaction.amount * -1`
  - Built-in function calls, such as `ROUND(transaction.amount, 2)`
  - User-defined function calls.

```bash
mysql> SELECT *
    -> FROM language;
+-------------+----------+---------------------+
| language_id | name     | last_update         |
+-------------+----------+---------------------+
|           1 | English  | 2006-02-15 05:02:19 |
|           2 | Italian  | 2006-02-15 05:02:19 |
|           3 | Japanese | 2006-02-15 05:02:19 |
|           4 | Mandarin | 2006-02-15 05:02:19 |
|           5 | French   | 2006-02-15 05:02:19 |
|           6 | German   | 2006-02-15 05:02:19 |
+-------------+----------+---------------------+
6 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

```bash
mysql> SELECT language_id,
    -> 'COMMON' language_usage,
    -> language_id * 3.1415927 lang_pi_value,
    -> upper(name) language_name
    -> FROM language;
+-------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+
| language_id | language_usage | lang_pi_value | language_name |
+-------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+
|           1 | COMMON         |     3.1415927 | ENGLISH       |
|           2 | COMMON         |     6.2831854 | ITALIAN       |
|           3 | COMMON         |     9.4247781 | JAPANESE      |
|           4 | COMMON         |    12.5663708 | MANDARIN      |
|           5 | COMMON         |    15.7079635 | FRENCH        |
|           6 | COMMON         |    18.8495562 | GERMAN        |
+-------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- we have also added **column alias** after each element of our `select` clause. (language_usage, lang_pi_value, and language_name).
- To stand out even more and improves readability, we can also add `as` keyword before the alias name.

```sql
mysql> SELECT language_id,
    -> 'COMMON' AS language_usage,
    -> language_id * 3.1415927 AS lang_pi_value,
    -> upper(name) AS language_name
    -> FROM language;
```



---

- If we only need to execute a built-in function or evaluate a simple expression, we can skip the `from` clause entirely.

```bash
mysql> SELECT version(),
    -> user(),
    -> database();
+-------------------------+----------------+------------+
| version()               | user()         | database() |
+-------------------------+----------------+------------+
| 8.0.42-0ubuntu0.24.04.1 | root@localhost | sakila     |
+-------------------------+----------------+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
