# Ascending Versus Descending Sort Order

- The default is ascending, so we would need to add the `desc` keyword if we want to use a descending sort.
- Descending sorts are commonly used for ranking queries:
  - Such as: "show me the top five account balances."

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name,
    -> time(r.rental_date) rental_time
    -> FROM customer c
    -> INNER JOIN rental r
    -> ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
    -> WHERE date(r.rental_date) = '2005-06-14'
    -> ORDER BY time(r.rental_date) desc;
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| first_name | last_name | rental_time |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
