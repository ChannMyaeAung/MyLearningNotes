# The order by Clause

- If we like the results to be in alphabetical order by last name, we can add the `last_name` column to the `order by` clause.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name,
    -> time(r.rental_date) rental_time
    -> FROM customer c
    -> INNER JOIN rental r
    -> ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
    -> WHERE date(r.rental_date) = '2005-06-14'
    -> ORDER BY c.last_name;
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| first_name | last_name | rental_time |
+------------+-----------+-------------+

| CATHERINE  | CAMPBELL  | 23:17:03    |
| HERMAN     | DEVORE    | 23:35:09    |
| AMBER      | DIXON     | 23:42:56    |

- In some cases, multiple people may have the same last name, so we may want to extend the sort criteria to include the person's first name as well.
- If we were to switch the order of the two columns in the `order by` clause, Amber Dixon would appear first in the result set.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name,
    -> time(r.rental_date) rental_time
    -> FROM customer c
    -> INNER JOIN rental r
    -> ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
    -> WHERE date(r.rental_date) = '2005-06-14'
    -> ORDER BY c.last_name, c.first_name;
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| first_name | last_name | rental_time |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
