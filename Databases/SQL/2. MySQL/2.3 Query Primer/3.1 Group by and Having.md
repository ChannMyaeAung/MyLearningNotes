# The group by and having Clauses

- `group by` : to group data by column values.

- When using the `group by` clause to generate groups of rows, we may also use the `having` clause, 

  - which allows us to filter grouped data in the same way the `where` clause lets us filter raw data.

- In the following example:

  - #### `SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, COUNT(*)`

    - This selects the **first name** and **last name** of customers, and **counts** the number of rentals associated with each customer.

  - Here, we are grouping the results **by customer specifically by their first and last name** (`GROUP BY c.first_name, c.last_name`)

    - So, all rentals belonging to the same person will be **aggregated together** in one row.

  - #### `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 40`

    - This filters the grouped results ,only customers who have **rented at least 40 times** will be included.
    - `HAVING` is used instead of `WHERE` because we're filtering **aggregated data** (`COUNT(*)`), not individual rows.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, count(*)
    -> FROM customer c
    -> INNER JOIN rental r
    -> On c.customer_id = r.customer_id
    -> GROUP BY c.first_name, c.last_name
    -> HAving count(*) >= 40;
+------------+-----------+----------+
| first_name | last_name | count(*) |
