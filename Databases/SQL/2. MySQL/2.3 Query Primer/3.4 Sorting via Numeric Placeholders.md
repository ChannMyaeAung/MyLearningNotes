# Sorting via Numeric Placeholders

- Note: Use this feature sparingly since adding a column to the `select` clause without changing the numbers in the `order by` clause can lead to unexpected results.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name,
    -> time(r.rental_date) rental_time
    -> FROM customer c
    -> INNER JOIN rental r
    -> ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
    -> WHERE date(r.rental_date) = '2005-06-14'
    -> ORDER BY 3 desc;
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| first_name | last_name | rental_time |
