# Tables

- Four different types of tables:
  - Permanent tables (created using the `create table` statement)
  - Derived tables (rows returned by a sub-query and held in memory)
  - Temporary tables (volatile data held in memory)
  - Virtual tables (created using the `create view` statement)

---

## Derived (sub-query-generated) tables

- A sub-query is a query contained within another query. (surrounded by parentheses).
  - serves the role of generating a derived table that is visible from all other query clauses.
  - can interact with other tables named in the `from` clause.

```bash
mysql> SELECT concat(cust.last_name, ', ', cust.first_name) full_name
    -> FROM
    -> (SELECT first_name, last_name, email
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE first_name = 'JESSIE'
    -> ) cust;
+---------------+
| full_name     |
+---------------+
| BANKS, JESSIE |
| MILAM, JESSIE |
+---------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- The sub-query is referenced by the containing query via its alias. (`cust`).
- The data in `cust` is held in memory for the duration of the query and is then discarded.

---

## Temporary tables

- These tables look just like permanent tables, but any data inserted into a temp table will disappear at some point.
  - Generally at the end of a transaction or
  - when the database session is closed.

```bash
mysql> CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE actors_j
    -> (actor_id smallint(5),
    -> first_name varchar(45),
    -> last_name varchar(45)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO actors_j
    -> SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
    -> FROM actor
    -> WHERE last_name LIKE 'J%';
Query OK, 7 rows affected (0.02 sec)
Records: 7  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

- These seven rows are held in memory temporarily and will disappear after the session is closed.
- `LIKE 'J%'`: A pattern match, `%` is a wildcard meaning "any characters after 'J'".
- Basically, inserts into `actors_j` all actors from the original `actor` table **whose last name starts with the letter J**.

```bash
mysql> SELECT * FROM actors_j;
+----------+------------+-----------+
| actor_id | first_name | last_name |
+----------+------------+-----------+
|      119 | WARREN     | JACKMAN   |
|      131 | JANE       | JACKMAN   |
|        8 | MATTHEW    | JOHANSSON |
|       64 | RAY        | JOHANSSON |
|      146 | ALBERT     | JOHANSSON |
|       82 | WOODY      | JOLIE     |
|       43 | KIRK       | JOVOVICH  |
+----------+------------+-----------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
