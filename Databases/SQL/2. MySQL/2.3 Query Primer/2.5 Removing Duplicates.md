# Removing Duplicates

- If we were to retrieve the IDs of all actors who appeared in a film in our database `sakila`, we would get around 5462 rows.

```bash
mysql> SELECT actor_id FROM film_actor ORDER BY actor_id;
...
...
...
5462 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- Since some actors appeared in more than one film, we will see the same actor ID multiple times.
- We can get a distinct set of actors by using the keyword `distinct` after the `select`.

```bash
mysql> SELECT DISTINCT actor_id FROM film_actor ORDER BY actor_id;
+----------+
| actor_id |
+----------+
|        1 |
|        2 |
...
...
|      198 |
|      199 |
|      200 |
+----------+
200 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
