- There are only 599 customers and 603 rows in the `address` table, but we ended up with 361,197 rows.
- Because the query didn't specify how the two tables should be joined, the database server generated the **Cartesian product**, which is every permutation of the two tables (599 customers * 603 addresses = 361,197 permutations).
- This type of join is a **cross join** and it's rarely used.
