# Joining Three or More Tables

- With a three-table join, there're three tables and two join types in the `from` clause and two `on` subclauses.
- Here, we will be joining `customer`, `address` and `city` tables.
- The city name is not stored in the `address` table but is accessed via a foreign key to the `city` table. (which in this case `city_id`).
- To show each customer's city, we will need to 
  - traverse from the `customer` table to the `address` table using the `address_id` column
  - then from the `address` table to the `city` table using the `city_id` column.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, ct.city
    -> FROM customer c
    -> INNER JOIN address a
    -> ON c.address_id = a.address_id
    -> INNER JOIN city ct
    -> ON a.city_id = ct.city_id;
...

```

- The table order doesn't matter, if we switch the order, we will still get the exact same results.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, ct.city
    -> FROM city ct
    -> INNER JOIN address a
    -> ON ct.city_id = a.city_id
    -> INNER JOIN customer c
    -> ON c.address_id = a.address_id;
```

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, ct.city
    -> FROM address a
    -> INNER JOIN city ct
    -> ON ct.city_id = a.city_id
    -> INNER JOIN customer c
    -> ON c.address_id = a.address_id;
```
