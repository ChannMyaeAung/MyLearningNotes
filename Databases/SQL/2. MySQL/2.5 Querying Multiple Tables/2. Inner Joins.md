# Inner Joins

- To make sure that only a single row is returned for each customer, we need to describe how the two tables are related.
- We should follow SQL92 join syntax for better comprehension. (`on` for joining and `where` for filtering).
- We can either specify the type of join, such as inner join or outer join.
- If we don't then the server will do an inner join by default.
- If a value exists for the `address_id` column in one table but not the other, then the join fails for the rows containing that value,
  - and those rows are excluded from the result set.
  - This is known as **an inner join**. (most commonly used type of join).
- In our two tables (customer & address tables), `customer.address_id` is the foreign key to the `address` table.
- The following query instructs the server to use the `customer.address_id` column as the transportation between the two tables.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address
    -> FROM customer c JOIN address a
    -> ON c.address_id = a.address_id;
...
...

- Here we construct the server to join the `customer` and `address` tables by using the `address_id` column to traverse from one table to another.
- We can choose whether we want to specify the type of join.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address
    -> FROM customer c INNER JOIN address a
    -> ON c.address_id = a.address_id;
```

- If the names of the columns used to join the two tables are identical, we can use the `using` subclause instead of the `on` subclause.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address
    -> FROM customer c INNER JOIN address a
    -> USING(address_id);
```
