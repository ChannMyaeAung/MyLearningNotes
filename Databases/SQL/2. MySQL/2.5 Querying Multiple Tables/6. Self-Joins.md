# Self-join

- Not only we can include the same table more than once in the same query, but we can actually join a table to itself.
- Some tables include a **self-referencing foreign key** which means that it includes a column that points to the primary key within the same table.
- Suppose the `film` table includes the column `prequel_film_id`, which points to the film's parent.
- The following query joins the `film` table to itself using the `prequel_film_id` foreign key.

```bash
mysql> SELECT f.title, f_prnt.title prequel
    -> FROM film f
    -> INNER JOIN film f_prnt
    -> ON f_prnt.film_id = f.prequel_film_id
    -> WHERE f.prequel_fiilm_id IS NOT NULL;
```
