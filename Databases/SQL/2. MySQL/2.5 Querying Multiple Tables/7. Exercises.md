```bash
mysql> SELECT title FROM film f
    -> INNER JOIN film_actor fa
    -> ON f.film_id = fa.film_id
    -> INNER JOIN actor a
    -> ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id
    -> WHERE a.first_name = 'JOHN';

5-3. Construct a query that returns all addresses that are in the same city. You will need to join the address table to itself, and each row should include two different addresses.

- `a1.address_id <> a2.address_id` would exclude pairing an address with itself.
- Using `a1.address_id < a2.address_id` additionally prevents duplicate mirror rows (i.e. weâ€™ll get `(100,200)` but not also `(200,100)`).

```bash
mysql> SELECT a1.city_id, a1.address, a2.address
    -> FROM address a1
    -> INNER JOIN address a2
    -> ON a1.city_id = a2.city_id
    -> AND a1.address_id < a2.address_id;
+---------+--------------------+----------------------+
| city_id | address            | address              |
+---------+--------------------+----------------------+
|     300 | 47 MySakila Drive  | 23 Workhaven Lane    |
|     576 | 28 MySQL Boulevard | 1411 Lillydale Drive |
|     312 | 1497 Yuzhou Drive  | 548 Uruapan Street   |
|      42 | 587 Benguela Manor | 43 Vilnius Manor     |
+---------+--------------------+----------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- We can also use `a1.address < a2.address` too.

```bash
mysql> SELECT a1.city_id, a1.address, a2.address
    -> FROM address a1
    -> INNER JOIN address a2
    -> ON a1.city_id = a2.city_id
    -> AND a1.address < a2.address;
+---------+----------------------+--------------------+
| city_id | address              | address            |
+---------+----------------------+--------------------+
|     300 | 23 Workhaven Lane    | 47 MySakila Drive  |
|     576 | 1411 Lillydale Drive | 28 MySQL Boulevard |
|     312 | 1497 Yuzhou Drive    | 548 Uruapan Street |
|      42 | 43 Vilnius Manor     | 587 Benguela Manor |
+---------+----------------------+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
