# Using the Same Table Twice

- If we want to find all of the films in which two specific actors appear, we can write a query which 
  - joins the `film` table to the `film_actor` table to the `actor` table.
- The following query returns all movies in which either Cate McQueen or Cuba Birch appeared.

```bash
mysql> SELECT f.title
    -> FROM film f
    -> INNER JOIN film_actor fa
    -> ON f.film_id = fa.film_id
    -> INNER JOIN actor a
    -> ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id
    -> WHERE ((a.first_name = 'CATE' AND a.last_name = 'MCQUEEN')
    -> OR (a.first_name = 'CUBA' AND a.last_name = 'BIRCH'));
+----------------------+
| title                |
+----------------------+
| ATLANTIS CAUSE       |
| BLOOD ARGONAUTS      |
| COMMANDMENTS EXPRESS |
| DYNAMITE TARZAN      |
| EDGE KISSING         |
...
...
...
| TROJAN TOMORROW      |
| VIRGIN DAISY         |
| VOLCANO TEXAS        |
| WATERSHIP FRONTIER   |
+----------------------+
54 rows in set (0.07 sec)
```



But what if we want to retrieve only those films in which both of these actors appeared?

- To accomplish this, we will need to 
  - find all rows in the `film` table that have two rows in the `film_actor` table, one of which is associated with Cate McQueen, and the other associated with Cuba Birch. 
  - Thus, we will need to include the `film_actor` and `actor` tables twice, 
    - each with a different alias so that the server knows which one we are referring to in the various clauses:

```bash
mysql> SELECT f.title
    -> FROM film f
    -> INNER JOIN film_actor fa1
    -> ON f.film_id = fa1.film_id
    -> INNER JOIN actor a1
    -> ON fa1.actor_id = a1.actor_id
    -> INNER JOIN film_actor fa2
    -> ON f.film_id = fa2.film_id
    -> INNER JOIN actor a2
    -> ON fa2.actor_id = a2.actor_id
    -> WHERE (a1.first_name = 'CATE' AND a1.last_name = 'MCQUEEN')
    -> AND (a2.first_name = 'CUBA' AND a2.last_name = 'BIRCH');
+------------------+
| title            |
+------------------+
| BLOOD ARGONAUTS  |
| TOWERS HURRICANE |
+------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- The two actors appeared in 52 different films but there are only two films in which both actors appeared.
