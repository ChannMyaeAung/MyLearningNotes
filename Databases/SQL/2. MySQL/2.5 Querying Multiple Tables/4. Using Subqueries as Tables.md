# Using Subqueries as Tables

- In the following query:
  - The subquery is given alias `addr`, finds all addresses that are in Californial.
  - The outer query joins the subquery results to the `customer` table to return the first name, last name, street address and city of all customers who live in California.

```bash
mysql> SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, addr.address, addr.city
    -> FROM customer c
    -> INNER JOIN
    -> (SELECT a.address_id, a.address, ct.city
    -> FROM address a
    -> INNER JOIN city ct
    -> ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
    -> WHERE a.district = 'California'
    -> ) addr
    -> ON c.address_id = addr.address_id;
+------------+-----------+------------------------+----------------+
| first_name | last_name | address                | city           |
+------------+-----------+------------------------+----------------+
| PATRICIA   | JOHNSON   | 1121 Loja Avenue       | San Bernardino |
| BETTY      | WHITE     | 770 Bydgoszcz Avenue   | Citrus Heights |
| ALICE      | STEWART   | 1135 Izumisano Parkway | Fontana        |
| ROSA       | REYNOLDS  | 793 Cam Ranh Avenue    | Lancaster      |
| RENEE      | LANE      | 533 al-Ayn Boulevard   | Compton        |
| KRISTIN    | JOHNSTON  | 226 Brest Manor        | Sunnyvale      |
| CASSANDRA  | WALTERS   | 920 Kumbakonam Loop    | Salinas        |
| JACOB      | LANCE     | 1866 al-Qatif Avenue   | El Monte       |
| RENE       | MCALISTER | 1895 Zhezqazghan Drive | Garden Grove   |

- One way we can visualize what's going on is to run the subquery by itself.

```bash
mysql> SELECT a.address_id, a.address, ct.city
    -> FROM address a
    -> INNER JOIN city ct
    -> ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
    -> WHERE a.district = 'California';
+------------+------------------------+----------------+
| address_id | address                | city           |
+------------+------------------------+----------------+
|          6 | 1121 Loja Avenue       | San Bernardino |
|         18 | 770 Bydgoszcz Avenue   | Citrus Heights |
|         55 | 1135 Izumisano Parkway | Fontana        |
|        116 | 793 Cam Ranh Avenue    | Lancaster      |
|        186 | 533 al-Ayn Boulevard   | Compton        |
|        218 | 226 Brest Manor        | Sunnyvale      |
|        274 | 920 Kumbakonam Loop    | Salinas        |
|        425 | 1866 al-Qatif Avenue   | El Monte       |
|        599 | 1895 Zhezqazghan Drive | Garden Grove   |
+------------+------------------------+----------------+
9 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- When joined to the `customer` table via the `address_id` column, our result set will contain information about the customers assigned to these addresses.
