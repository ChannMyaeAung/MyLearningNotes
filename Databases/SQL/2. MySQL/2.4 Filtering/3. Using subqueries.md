# Using subqueries

- The subquery returns the set 'G' and 'PG' and the main query checks to see whether the value of the `rating` column can be found in the set returned by the subquery.
- It returns **all films** (title and rating) from the `film` table that share the **same rating** as any film whose **title contains the word "PET"**.

```bash
mysql> SELECT title, rating
    -> FROM film
    -> WHERE rating IN (SELECT rating FROM film WHERE title LIKE '%PET%');
...
...
...
| WON DARES                 | PG     |
| WONDERLAND CHRISTMAS      | PG     |
| WORDS HUNTER              | PG     |
| WORST BANGER              | PG     |
| YOUNG LANGUAGE            | G      |
