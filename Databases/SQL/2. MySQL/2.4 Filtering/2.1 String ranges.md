# String ranges

- Below is a query that returns customers whose last name falls between FA and FR.
  - `'FA'` includes any name starting with "FA" (e.g., **FARNSWORTH**).
  - `'FR'` includes any name that comes **alphabetically before or equal to** "FR".
  - It's **not** just names that start with "FA" or "FR".
  - It includes **everything in between**, like "FE", "FI", "FO", etc.

```bash
mysql> SELECT last_name, first_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE last_name BETWEEN 'FA' AND 'FR';

- While there are 5 customers whose last name starts with FR, but they are not included, since a name like FRANKLIN is outside of the range.
- We can pick up for of the five customers by extending the righthand range to FRB:

```bash
mysql> SELECT last_name, first_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE last_name BETWEEN 'FA' AND 'FRB';
+------------+------------+
| last_name  | first_name |
+------------+------------+
| FARNSWORTH | JOHN       |
| FENNELL    | ALEXANDER  |
| FERGUSON   | BERTHA     |
| FERNANDEZ  | MELINDA    |
| FIELDS     | VICKI      |
| FISHER     | CINDY      |
| FLEMING    | MYRTLE     |
