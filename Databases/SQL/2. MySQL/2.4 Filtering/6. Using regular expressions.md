# Using regular expressions

- If we find that the wildcard characters don't provide enough flexibility, we can use regular expressions to build search expressions.
- `REGEXP` tells MySQL to treat the right-hand side as a regular expression.
  - `^[QY]`:
    - `^`: start of the string
    - `[QY]`: a character class matching either Q or Y.
  - So `last_name REGEXP '^[QY]'` filters in every row whose `last_name` begins with either Q or Y.

```bash
mysql> SELECT last_name, first_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE last_name REGEXP '^[QY]';
+-------------+------------+
| last_name   | first_name |
+-------------+------------+
| YOUNG       | CYNTHIA    |
| QUALLS      | STEPHEN    |
| QUINTANILLA | ROGER      |
| YANEZ       | LUIS       |
| YEE         | MARVIN     |
| QUIGLEY     | TROY       |
