# Matching Conditions

- `LEFT(str, n)`:  takes the first `n` characters of the string `str`.
  - In our case, `Left(last_name, 1)` returns the first letter of each customer's last name.
- This query returns the first and last names of all customers whose last name starts with the letter "Q".

```bash
mysql> SELECT last_name, first_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE left(last_name, 1) = 'Q';
+-------------+------------+
| last_name   | first_name |
+-------------+------------+
| QUALLS      | STEPHEN    |
| QUINTANILLA | ROGER      |
| QUIGLEY     | TROY       |
+-------------+------------+
3 rows in set (0.03 sec)
```

## Using wildcards

- We could achieve the same result (and often more efficiently, if we have an index on `last_name`) with a pattern-matching predicate:
  - `LIKE` operator is used for pattern matching in strings. It is more flexible than the `=` operator.
  - `'Q%'`: Looks for a last name that starts with the literal character 'Q'. `%` is a wildcard character that **matches** any sequence of zero or more characters. So `'Q%'` means "starts with Q" followed by anything (or nothing).

```bash
mysql> SELECT last_name, first_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE last_name LIKE 'Q%'
    -> ;
+-------------+------------+
| last_name   | first_name |
+-------------+------------+
| QUALLS      | STEPHEN    |
| QUIGLEY     | TROY       |
| QUINTANILLA | ROGER      |
+-------------+------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- We can also use multiple search expressions.

```bash
mysql> SELECT last_name, first_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE last_name LIKE 'Q%' OR last_name LIKE 'Y%';
+-------------+------------+
| last_name   | first_name |
+-------------+------------+
| QUALLS      | STEPHEN    |
| QUIGLEY     | TROY       |
| QUINTANILLA | ROGER      |
| YANEZ       | LUIS       |
| YEE         | MARVIN     |
| YOUNG       | CYNTHIA    |
+-------------+------------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### Wildcard characters

| Wildcard character | Matches                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `_`                | Exactly one character                  |
| `%`                | Any number of characters (including 0) |

### Sample search expressions

| Search expression     | Interpretation                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `F%`                  | Strings beginning with F                                     |
| `%t`                  | Strings ending with t                                        |
| `%bas%`               | Strings containing the substring `'bas'`                     |
| _ _ t _               | Four-character strings with a t in the third position        |
| _ _ _ - _ _ - _ _ _ _ | 11-character strings with dashes in the 4th and 7th positions |

Breaking down `_A_T%S`  in the following query:

```sql
1st character: any ( _ )
2nd character:     A
3rd character: any ( _ )
4th character:     T
then any number of characters ( % )
and finally ending with   S
```

- So it finds last names that

  - Are at least 5 characters long (because we have two underscores + two literals + a final “S”).

  - Have “A” as their **2nd** letter.

  - Have “T” as their **4th** letter.

  - End with an “S”.

```bash
mysql> SELECT last_name, first_name
    -> FROM customer
    -> WHERE last_name LIKE '_A_T%S';
+-----------+------------+
| last_name | first_name |
+-----------+------------+
| MATTHEWS  | ERICA      |
| WALTERS   | CASSANDRA  |
| WATTS     | SHELLY     |
+-----------+------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
