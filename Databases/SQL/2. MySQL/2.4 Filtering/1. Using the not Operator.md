# Using the NOT Operator

```bash
mysql> SELECT * FROM customer
    -> WHERE (first_name = 'STEVEN' OR last_name = 'YOUNG')
    -> AND create_date > '2006-01-01';
```

- It's difficult for a person to evaluate a `where` clause that includes the `not` operator.
- We can rewrite the `where` clause to avoid using the `not` operator.

```bash
mysql> SELECT * FROM customer
    -> WHERE first_name <> 'STEVEN' AND last_name <> 'YOUNG'
    -> AND create_date > '2006-01-01'
    -> ;
```
