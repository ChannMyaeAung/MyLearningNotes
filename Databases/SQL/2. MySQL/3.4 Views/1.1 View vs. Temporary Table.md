# View vs. Temporary Table

| Feature              | Temporary Table                                              | View                                                         |

| **Definition**       | A real table whose data lives in temp storage, created with `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE`. | A named `SELECT` statement; no data is stored, created with `CREATE VIEW`. |
| **Scope & Lifetime** | Visible **only** to your session; automatically dropped when you disconnect (or explicitly with `DROP TEMPORARY TABLE`). | Persistent database object; exists until you `DROP VIEW` (and is shared by all sessions). |
| **Data Storage**     | Data is materialized row‑by‑row in temporary space. You can `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` freely. | No storage of rows; every query against a view reruns its underlying `SELECT`. You cannot insert into a view unless it’s an *updatable* view. |
| **Indexes**          | You can define indexes on temp tables to speed up lookups:   |                                                              |
