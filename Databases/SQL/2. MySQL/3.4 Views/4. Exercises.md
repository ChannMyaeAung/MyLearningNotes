14-2. The film rental company manager would like to have a report that includes the name of every country, along with the total payments for all customers who live in each country. Generate a view definition that queries the `country` table and uses a scalar subquery to calculate a value for a column named `tot_payments`.

**ANS:**

```mysql
CREATE VIEW country_payment_summary AS
    SELECT
        co.country_id,
        co.country AS country_name,
        (
            SELECT SUM(p.amount)
            FROM payment AS p
            JOIN customer AS c
            ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
            JOIN address AS a
            ON c.address_id = a.address_id
            JOIN city AS ct
            ON a.city_id = ct.city_id
            WHERE ct.country_id = co.country_id
        ) AS tot_payments
FROM country AS co;

SELECT * FROM country_payment_summary;
```
