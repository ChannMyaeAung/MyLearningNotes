# ACID

A **transaction** in MySQL is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single, atomic unit of work.  Transactions give us the **ACID** guarantees:

1. **Atomicity**
    • *All or nothing.*  Either every statement in the transaction succeeds, or none of them take effect.
2. **Consistency**
    • The database moves from one valid state to another, preserving integrity constraints.
3. **Isolation**
    • Concurrent transactions don’t “see” each other’s intermediate changes.
4. **Durability**
    • Once committed, the results survive crashes or power losses (provided you’re using a transactional storage engine like InnoDB).
