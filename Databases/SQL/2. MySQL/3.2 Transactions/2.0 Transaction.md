# What is a Transaction?

- A device for grouping together multiple SQL statements such that either all or none of the statements succeed (a property known as atomicity).
- Example:
  - If we attempt to transfer $500 from our savings account to our checking account, we would be upset if the money was deducted from the saving accounts but never made it to our checking account.
  - Possible reasons might be server was shutdown for maintenance or the request for a page lock on the account table timed out.
  - To protect this kind of error, 
    1. The program that handles the transfer request would first begin a transaction.
    2. Then, issue the SQL statements needed to move the money from the savings to checking account,
    3. If everything succeeds, end the transaction by issuing the `commit` command.
    4. If something unexpected happens, the program would issue a `rollback` command, which instructs the server to undo all changes made since the transaction began.

**The entire process**

```css
START TRANSACTION;

 /* withdraw money from first account, making sure balance is sufficient */
UPDATE account SET avail_balance = avail_balance - 500
WHERE account_id = 9988
  AND avail_balance > 500;

IF <exactly one row was updated by the previous statement> THEN
  /* deposit money into second account */
  UPDATE account SET avail_balance = avail_balance + 500
    WHERE account_id = 9989;

  IF <exactly one row was updated by the previous statement> THEN
    /* everything worked, make the changes permanent */
    COMMIT;
  ELSE
    /* something went wrong, undo all changes in this transaction */
    ROLLBACK;
  END IF;
ELSE
  /* insufficient funds, or error encountered during update */
  ROLLBACK;
END IF;
```
