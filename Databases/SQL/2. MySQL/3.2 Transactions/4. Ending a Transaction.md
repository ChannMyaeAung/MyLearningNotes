# Ending a Transaction

- Once we start a transaction either explicitly or implicitly, we must explicitly end our transaction for our change to become permanent.
- We do this by way of the `commit` command, which instructs the server to mark the changes as permanent and release any resources (page or row locks) used during the transaction.
- The transaction can also end as a result of these:
  - The server shuts down, in which case your transaction will be rolled back automatically when the server is restarted.
  - You issue an SQL schema statement, such as `alter table`, which will cause the current transaction to be committed and a new transaction to be started.
  - You issue another `start transaction` command, which will cause the previous transaction to be committed.
  - The server prematurely ends your transaction because the server detects a *deadlock* and decides that your transaction is the culprit. In this case, the transaction will be rolled back, and you will receive an error message.
