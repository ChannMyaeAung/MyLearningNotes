# Locking

- The mechanism the database server uses to control simultaneous use of data resources.
- When some portion of the database is locked, any other uses wishing to modify or read that data must wait until the lock has been released.

## Lock Granularities

- A number of strategies we can employ when deciding how to lock a resource.
- The server may apply a lock at one of three different levels or granularities:
  - **Table locks**: Keep multiple users from modifying data in the same table simultaneously
  - **Page locks**: keep multiple users from modifying data on the same page (a page is a segment of memory generally in the range of 2KB to 16KB) of a table simultaneously
  - **Raw locks**: Keep multiple users from modifying the same row in a table simultaneously.
