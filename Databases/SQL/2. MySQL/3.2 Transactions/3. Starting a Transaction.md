# Starting a Transaction

- **Oracle Database:** An active transaction is always associated with a database session, so there is no need or method to explicitly begin a transaction. 
  - When the current transaction ends, the server automatically begins a new transaction for our session.
- **Microsoft SQL Server & MySQL:** Unless we explicitly begin a transaction, individual SQL statements are automatically committed independently of one another. 
  - To begin a transaction, we must first issue a command.
- The SQL:2003 standard includes a `start transaction` command to be used when we want to explicitly begin a transaction.
- While MySQL confronts to the standard, SQL server users must instead issue the command `begin transaction`.
- With both servers, until we explicitly begin a transaction, we are in **autocommit mode**, which means that individual statements are automatically commited by the server.
- MySQL allows us to disable autocommit mode via the following:

```mysql
SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0
```

- Once we have left autocommit mode, all SQL commands take place within the scope of a transaction and must be explicitly committed or rolled back.
- We should shut off autocommit mode each time you log in, and get in the habit of running all of your SQL statements within a transaction to avoid having to ask DBA to reconstruct data that we might have inadvertently deleted.
