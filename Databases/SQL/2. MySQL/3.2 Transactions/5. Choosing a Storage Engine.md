# Choosing a Storage Engine

- As of version 8.0, MySQL includes the following storage engines:
- **MyISAM:** A nontransactional engine employing table locking
- **MEMORY:** A nontransactional engine used for in-memory tables
- **CSV:** A transactional engine that stores data in comma-separated files
- **InnoDB:** A transactional engine employing row-level locking
- **Merge:** A specialty engine used to make multiple identical MyISAM tables appear as a single table (a.k.a. table partitioning)
- **Archive:** A specialty engine used to store large amounts of unindexed data, mainly for archival purposes

```bash
mysql> show table status like 'customer'\G;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           Name: customer
         Engine: InnoDB

```

- We can see that the `customer` table is already using the InnoDB engine.
- We could also assign the InnoDB engine to the transaction table via the following command.

```mysql
ALTER TABLE customer ENGINE = INNODB;
```

- All savepoints must be given a name, which allows us to have multiple savepoints within a single transaction.

- To create a savepoint named `my_savepoint`:

  ```mysql
  SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
  ```

- To roll back to a particular savepoint,

```mysql
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
```

- Example of how savepoints may be used:

```mysql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE product
SET date_retired = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHERE product_cd = 'XYZ';

SAVEPOINT before_close_accounts;

UPDATE account
SET status = 'CLOSED', close_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
  last_activity_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHERE product_cd = 'XYZ';

ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_close_accounts;
COMMIT;
```

- Despite the name, nothing is saved when we create a savepoint. 
  - We must eventually issue a `commit` if we want our transaction to be made permanent.
- If we issue a `rollback` without naming a savepoint, all savepoints within the transaction will be ignored, and the entire transaction will be undone.
