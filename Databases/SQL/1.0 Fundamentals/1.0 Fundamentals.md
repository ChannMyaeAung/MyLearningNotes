# SQL Fundamentals

- SQL is **declarative**. 
  - We don't tell the database how to get the data (e.g., "open this file, read these bytes, find the index...")
  - Instead, we declare **what** data we want, and the database's query optimizer figures out the most efficient way to retrieve or manipulate it.
- Most SQL implementations treat any text between the `/*` and `*/` tags as comments. 

```sql
SELECT /* one or more things */...
FROM /* one or more places */
WHERE /* one or more conditions apply */...
```

## **`SELECT`  & Filtering:**

- `SELECT` statement describes a set of data to retrieve based on conditions, without specifying the order of processing. 

- Syntax: `SELECT [columns] FROM [table_name] WHERE [conditions];`

  ```sql
  -- Select the name and email columns from the users table...
  SELECT name, email 
  FROM users
  WHERE country = 'Canada' AND age > 30; -- ... for users who are from Canada AND over 30. 
  ```

- **Filtering with `WHERE`**: Fundamental logic of zeroing in on the data we need. Uses operators like `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `LIKE` (for pattern matching), and `IN`.

- `ORDER BY`:  Arranges the results. `ORDER BY created_at DESC;` (newest first).

  ```sql
  SELECT id, name
  FROM users
  WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com'
  ORDER BY created DESC 
  LIMIT 10; 
  ```

```sql
SELECT cust_id, fname
FROM individual
WHERE Iname = 'Smith';
```

- This query searches the `individual` table for all rows whose `Iname` column matches the string `'Smith'` and returns the `cust_id` and `fname` columns from these rows.

---

## **Keys & Constraints**

- SQL leverages relationships between tables (via keys like primary and foreign keys) to join and correlate data across multiple sources. 
- **Primary Key**: unique row identifier (e.g. `id`)
- **Foreign Key**: enforces relationships between tables.
- **Unique, NOT NULL, CHECK, DEFAULT**, etc.

---

## **Summarizing with `GROUP BY` and Aggregate Functions:** 

- `COUNT()`: How many rows.
- `SUM()`: The total of a numeric column.
- `AVG()`: The average.

```sql
-- Find the number of users in each country
SELECT country, COUNT(id)
FROM users
GROUP BY country; 
```

```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY user_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```



---

## Tables

- Two-dimensional structures of **rows (records)** and **columns (fields)**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- auto-incremented unique identifier
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, -- user's full name, required
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- user's email address, must be unique
    created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- record creation timestamp, defaults to now 
);
```

- `SERIAL` is PostgreSQL’s shorthand for “integer + auto-increment sequence.”
  - Every new row gets a unique integer id automatically.
  - `PRIMARY KEY` enforces uniqueness and creates a B-tree index for fast lookups by id.
- `VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL`
  - A text field up to 100 characters.
  - `NOT NULL` prevents missing values. 
- `UNIQUE` adds a constraint (and index) so two users cannot share the same email. 

---



## Combining Tables with `JOIN`.

- Data is often split into multiple related tables (e.g., a `users` table and an `orders` table).
- `JOIN` lets us combine them in a query. 

```sql
-- Get all orders with the name of the user who placed it 
SELECT users.name, orders.amount, orders.order_date
FROM orders 
INNER JOIN users ON orders.user_id = users.id; -- The join condition links the two tables 
```

```sql
SELECT u.name, o.total
FROM users u 
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.total > 100
```

---

## Changing the Data (Creating, Updating, Deleting)

`INSERT`: Adds a new row.

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, country) VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com', 'USA');
```

`UPDATE`: Modifies existing rows. 

- The `WHERE` clause is critical here to avoid updating every row in the table.

```sql
UPDATE users SET country = 'United States' WHERE country = 'USA';
```

```sql
UPDATE product
SET name = 'Certificate of Deposit'
WHERE product_cd = 'CD';
```



`DELETE`: Removes rows. Again, `WHERE` is critical.

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE email = 'alice@example.com';
```

---

## Transactions

- Use `ROLLBACK` to undo on error.

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT; 
```
