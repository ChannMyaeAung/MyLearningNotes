# Entering SQL statements via `psql`

- We can use either `\g` or `;` to execute the statement.
  - Until we end a statement with either one, `psql` will keep the content we are typing in the query buffer.

```bash
mytestdb=# SELECT current_time;
    current_time
--------------------
 23:02:22.492855+07
(1 row)
mytestdb=# SELECT current_time \g
    current_time
--------------------
 23:03:13.469354+07
(1 row)

```

- It is also possible to execute all the statements included in a file or edit a file before executing it.
- We can use the `\i` special command followed by the name of the file.
- To edit the file without leaving `psql`, we can issue `\e test.sql` to open our favorite editor, make changes and come back to the `psql` connection.

```bash
~ âž¤ cat test.sql
SELECT current_database();
SELECT current_time;
SELECT current_role;
```

```bash
mytestdb=# \i test.sql
 current_database
------------------
 mytestdb
(1 row)

    current_time
--------------------
 23:10:55.770946+07
(1 row)

 current_role
--------------
 chan
(1 row)
```
