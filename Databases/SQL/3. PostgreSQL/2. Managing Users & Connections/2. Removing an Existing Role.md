# Removing an existing role

- We need to specify only the role name we want to delete.
- To delete multiple roles, we can specify them as a comma-separated list.

```postgresql
DROP ROLE [IF EXIST] name[, ...]
```

- In order to be deleted, the role must exist; 
- Therefore, if we try to remove a nonexistent role, we will receive an error:

```bash
postgres=# DROP ROLE this_role_does_not_exist;
ERROR:  role "this_role_does_not_exist" does not exist
```

- It also suppors the `IF EXISTS` clause, which stops PostgreSQL from complaining about the deletion of a role that is missing.

```bash
postgres=# DROP ROLE IF EXISTS this_role_does_not_exist;
NOTICE:  role "this_role_does_not_exist" does not exist, skipping
DROP ROLE
```

- It prevents automated tasks from being interrupted.
