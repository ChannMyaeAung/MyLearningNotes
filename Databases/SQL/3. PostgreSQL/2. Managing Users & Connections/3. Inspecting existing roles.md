# Inspecting existing roles

- `CURRENT_ROLE` , we can query it via a `SELECT` statement.

```bash
postgres=# SELECT current_role;
 current_role
--------------
 chan
(1 row)
```

- `\du` (describe users) command to list all the available roles within the system.
  - If a role is prevented from connecting interactively to the cluster, a `Cannot login` message will be displayed.

```bash
postgres=# \du
																List of roles
   Role name    |                         Attributes
----------------+------------------------------------------------------------
 admin          | Superuser, Create role, Create DB
 book_authors   | Cannot login
 book_reviewers | Cannot login
 chan           | Superuser
 chann          |
 enrico         |
 postgres       | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS
```

- We can get information about a specific role by directly querying the `pg_roles` catalog, a catalog that contains information about all PostgreSQL roles. 
- E.g., to get the basic connection information for the `chann` role, we can execute the following query:
  - The password is not displayed for security reasons, even if the cluster superuser is asking for it. 
  - It is not possible to get the password in plain text: the passwords are always stored encrypted.
  - The special catalog `pg_authid` represents the backbone for the `pg_roles` information, and can be queried with the very same statement, but reports the user password (as encrypted text).

```bash
postgres=# SELECT rolname, rolcanlogin,
postgres-# rolconnlimit, rolpassword
postgres-# FROM pg_roles
postgres-# WHERE rolname = 'chann';
 rolname | rolcanlogin | rolconnlimit | rolpassword
---------+-------------+--------------+-------------
 chann   | t           |           -1 | ********
(1 row)
```
