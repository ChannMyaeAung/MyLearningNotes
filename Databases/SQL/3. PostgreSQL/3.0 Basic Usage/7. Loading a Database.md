# Loading a database to postgres

- Usually we get the default database called "postgres" when we first install the postgres on our system.
- We can create a new database via the CLI or GUI apps, and we can load some sample data by doing the following:
  - Download a sample database and store somewhere on the system.
  - For me, it was the default `dvdrental` database from postgresql.
  - Extract the `tar` file to the directory such as `E:\sampledb\postgres\dvdrental.tar` on Windows.
  - Then, load the database using the `pg_restore` command:

```bash
PS C:\Users\User> pg_restore -U postgres -d dvdrental E:\sampledb\postgres\dvdrental.tar
Password:
```

- Then we can verify the sample database by typing the following:

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

```bash
dvdrental=# \c dvdrental
You are now connected to database "dvdrental" as user "postgres".
dvdrental=# \dt
