# Installing MySQL on Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade 
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
```

```bash
mysql --version
```

```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql 
```

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

- During this process, we'll be prompted to:
  - Set a root password (choose a strong one).
  - Remove anonymous users (recommended: answer 'yes').
  - Disallow root login remotely (recommended: answer 'yes' for security).
  - Remove the test database (recommended: answer 'yes').
  - Reload privilege tables (answer 'yes' to apply changes).



- Start MySQL if it's not running

```bash
sudo service mysql start
```

- Log into MySQL as root

```bash
sudo mysql -u root
```
