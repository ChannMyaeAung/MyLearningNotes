# The thread model join and the process model wait

- **Scope and Use-Case:**
  - `pthread_join(3)`: 
    - Used exclusively for waiting on threads (created with `pthread_create`) within the same process. 
    - Allows one thread to wait for another to finish execution.
  - `wait(2)`: 
    - Used for waiting on child processes (spawned via fork) to terminate.
    - Part of process management and helps prevent zombie processes.
- **Signaling**:
  - `pthread_join(3)`: No signal is sent upon a thread's death.
  - `wait(2)`: Upon a process's death, the kernel sends the `SIGCHLD` signal to the parent process.
- **Hierarchy:**
  - `pthread_join(3)`: 
    - None. 
    - Any thread can join on any other thread.
    - No requirements of a parent-child relationship.
    - All threads are peers.
  - `wait(2)`: 
    - A strict parent-child hierarchy exists.
    - Only a parent can wait for a child process.
- **Function Signature and Return:**
  - `pthread_join(3)`: 
    - Has the signature `int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);` 
    - Returns a pointer to the thread’s exit value via the second parameter.
  - `wait(2)`: 
    - Has the signature `pid_t wait(int *status);` 
    - Returns the process ID of the terminated child and fills the status information in the provided pointer.
- **Condition:**
  - `pthread_join(3)`: 
    - A thread being waited for must have its detached state attribute set as joinable, not detached.
  - `wait(2)`: 
    - None.
    - Any child process must be waited upon.
- **Order:**
  - `pthread_join(3)`: 
    - With threads, one is forced to join (wait) upon the particular thread specified as the param to `pthread_join(3)`.
    - E.g three threads are running and main issues the join within an ascending ordered loop, then it must wait for the death of thread #1, then thread #2, and then thread #3. 
      - If thread #2 terminates earlier, no help for it.
  - `wait(2)`: 
    - A process can wait upon the death or stoppage of any child, or specify a particular child process to wait for with `waitpid`.
- **Communication and Sharing:**
  - `pthread_join(3)`: 
    - Works with threads that share the same memory space, so data can be shared easily among threads.
  - `wait(2)`: 
    - Works with separate processes that do not share memory by default, so inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms are needed for data exchange.

**Note**: While both functions are used for synchronization by waiting for an execution unit (thread or process) to finish, they serve very different paradigms—multithreading versus multiprocessing.
