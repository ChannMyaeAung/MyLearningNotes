# Overlapping CPU with I/O

- In this context, CPU refers to software that is CPU-intensive, I/O refers to software that is in a blocked state that it is waiting on I/O, meaning that is is waiting on some other operation to complete (a file or network read or any blocking API) before it can move forward. 
  - This is referred to as I/O bound.

**Example**:

- Let's also say that task A and task C are highly CPU-bound, whereas task B and task D are more I/O-bound. 
- If we use the traditional single threaded approach, then of course each task has to be c**arried out in sequence**; so, the process ends up waiting—for perhaps a long while—for tasks B and D, thus delaying task C. 
- If, on the other hand, we use a multithreaded approach, we can separate the tasks as individual
  threads. 
- Thus, even while the threads for tasks B and D are blocked on I/O, the threads for task A and C continue to make progress.
- This is called overlapping CPU with I/O. 
  - Decoupling (and separating out) tasks when there is no dependency between them, by using threads, is a design approach that is usually worth pursuing. It leads to better application responsiveness.
