# Thread Termination

- The `exit(3)` library API causes the calling process - along with all of its threads to terminate.
- If we would like a single thread to terminate, invoke the `pthread_exit(3)` instead.

```c
#define NTHREADS 3

void *worker(void *data)
{
    long datum = (long)data;
    printf("Work thread #%ld running...\n", datum);
    printf("#%ld: work done, exiting now\n", datum);
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

int main()
{
    long i;
    int ret;
    pthread_t tid;

    for (i = 0; i < NTHREADS; i++)
    {
        // just providing the name of the func is enough, the compiler will figure.
        ret = pthread_create(&tid, NULL, worker, (void *)i);
        if (ret)
        {
            perror("pthread_create");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }

#if 1
    pthread_exit(NULL);
#else
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
#endif
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Work thread #0 running...
#0: work done, exiting now
Work thread #2 running...
#2: work done, exiting now
Work thread #1 running...
#1: work done, exiting now
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Work thread #1 running...
#1: work done, exiting now
Work thread #2 running...
#2: work done, exiting now
Work thread #0 running...
#0: work done, exiting now

```

- The output order of the threads is different each time because thread scheduling is non-deterministic. 
  - **Thread Scheduling**: The operating system's scheduler decides which thread runs at any given time. This decision can vary between runs, leading to different execution orders.
  - **Concurrency**: Multiple threads are running concurrently, and their execution order is not guaranteed to be the same each time.
- The operating system's scheduler determines which thread runs at any given time, and this can vary between runs.
- If we need to ensure a specific order of execution, we can use synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes, condition variables, or semaphores.
