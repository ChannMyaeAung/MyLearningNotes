# Additional Notes

- What if the thread we are waiting for (to die) has already died?
  - Then `pthread_join(3)` just returns immediately.
- What if a thread tries to join upon itself?
  - Results in failure with `errno` set to `EDEADLK`.
- Attempting to have several threads join upon one thread results in undefined behavior.
- If a thread trying to join on another thread is cancelled, the target thread remains as it was (joinable).
- A thread that is explicitly set to the detached state cannot be joined upon. So what happens when it dies?
  - Its resources are disposed of by the library.
- A thread that is explicitly set to the joinable state, must be join upon.
  - Failure to do so results in a kind of resource leakage.
- Performing a join on other app threads by the main thread is usually considered a optimal practice.
  - Since it prevents the zombie thread.
