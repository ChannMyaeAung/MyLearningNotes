# How many threads we can create?

With regard to threads, there are two limits that impact  the number of threads that can exist at any given point int time:

1. **Per process resource limits:**
   - By default, the per-process resource limit for the max number of threads is half of the system limit.

```sh
chan@CMA:~$ ulimit -u
61053
chan@CMA:~$ prlimit --nproc
RESOURCE DESCRIPTION              SOFT  HARD UNITS
NPROC    max number of processes 61053 61053 processes
chan@CMA:~$ 
```

2. **System-wide limits:** The total number of threads that can be alive at any given point in time.

```sh
chan@CMA:~$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
122107
```

- The OS sets the `threads-max` limit at boot time base on the amount of RAM on the system.

- Either of the preceding two limits are breached, `pthread_create(3)` will fail.

## Code example - creating any number of threads

```c
void *worker(void *data)
{
    long datum = (long)data;
    printf("Work thread #%ld running...\n", datum);
    (void)pause();
    printf("#%5ld: work done, exiting now\n", datum);
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    long i;
    int ret;
    pthread_t tid;
    long numthreads = 0;

    if (argc != 2)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s number-of-threads-to-create\n", argv[0]);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    numthreads = atol(argv[1]);

    if (numthreads <= 0)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Invalid number of threads: %ld\n", numthreads);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    for (i = 0; i < numthreads; i++)
    {
        ret = pthread_create(&tid, NULL, worker, (void *)i);
        if (ret)
        {
            perror("pthread_create");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }

    pthread_exit(NULL);
}
```

- Once created, the new threads will execute the code of the `worker` function.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Usage: ./final number-of-threads-to-create
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final 8
Work thread #4 running...
Work thread #0 running...
Work thread #3 running...
Work thread #6 running...
Work thread #5 running...
Work thread #1 running...
Work thread #7 running...
Work thread #2 running...
^C
```
