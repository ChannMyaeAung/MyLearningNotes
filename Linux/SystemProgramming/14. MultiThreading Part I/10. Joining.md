# Joining

- Used to wait for a specific thread to finish its execution.
- When we call `pthread_join`, the calling thread blocks until the target thread terminates.
- Allows us to retrieve the return value of the terminated thread and ensures that any resources allocated for that thread are properly cleaned up.

```c
#include <pthread.h>
int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);
```

- 1st param (`thread`): the ID of the thread of wait for.
- The moment it terminates, the calling thread will receive, in the second param, the return value from the thread that terminated. (The value passed via its `pthread_exit(3)`).
- Using `pthread_join` we can ensure that a thread can **block upon the termination of any given thread**.
  - In the case of the main thread, we use this to ensure that main waits for all other application threads to terminate before it itself terminates, thus preventing the zombie.

---

## Code Example

- To perform the join subsequently, we require each thread's ID: hence, we declare an array of `pthread_t` (the `tid` variable). Each element will store the corresponding thread's ID value.
- `pthread_attr_init(3)` is used to initialize (to defaults) an attribute structure.
- Made the threads joinable by setting up this attribute within the structure (via the `pthread_attr_setdetachstate(3)` API).
  - Only threads that have their detach state set as joinable can be joined upon.
- Once the threads are created, we must destroy the thread attribute structure via the `pthread_attr_destroy(3)`.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
main: creating thread #0 ...
main: creating thread #1 ...
main: creating thread #2 ...
main: joining (waiting) upon thread #0 ...
 worker #0: will sleep for 8s now ...
 worker #2: will sleep for 8s now ...
 worker #1: will sleep for 8s now ...
 worker #0: work (eyeroll) done, exiting now
 worker #2: work (eyeroll) done, exiting now
 worker #1: work (eyeroll) done, exiting now
Thread #0 successfully joined; it terminated with status=0
main: joining (waiting) upon thread #1 ...
Thread #1 successfully joined; it terminated with status=0
main: joining (waiting) upon thread #2 ...
Thread #2 successfully joined; it terminated with status=0

main: now dying... <Dramatic!> Farewell!

```

- The main thread blocks (waits) upon the death of each worker thread via the `pthread_join(3)`.
- As the worker threads die, they are picked up or joined by the main thread via `pthread_join`. 
- Not only that, their termination statue, "return value", can be examined.



**Instead of having each worker thread sleep for an identical 8 seconds, now we will make the sleep time dynamic:**

- All codes remain the same, but a few changes only in the worker function.

```c
void *worker(void *data)
{
    long datum = (long)data;
    int slptm = 8;

    printf(" worker #%ld: will sleep for %lds now ...\n", datum, (slptm - datum));
    sleep(slptm - datum);
    printf(" worker #%ld: work (eyeroll) done, exiting now\n", datum);

    /* Terminate with success: status value 0.
     * The join will pick this up. */
    pthread_exit((void *)0);
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
main: creating thread #0 ...
main: creating thread #1 ...
main: creating thread #2 ...
main: joining (waiting) upon thread #0 ...
 worker #0: will sleep for 8s now ...
 worker #1: will sleep for 7s now ...
 worker #2: will sleep for 6s now ...
 worker #2: work (eyeroll) done, exiting now
 worker #1: work (eyeroll) done, exiting now
 worker #0: work (eyeroll) done, exiting now
Thread #0 successfully joined; it terminated with status=0
main: joining (waiting) upon thread #1 ...
Thread #1 successfully joined; it terminated with status=0
main: joining (waiting) upon thread #2 ...
Thread #2 successfully joined; it terminated with status=0

main: now dying... <Dramatic!> Farewell!
```

- Despite the work thread #2 dying first, the worker thread #0 gets joined first because in the code, that is the thread we wait for first.
