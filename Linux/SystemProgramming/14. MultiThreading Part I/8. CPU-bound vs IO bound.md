# CPU-bound & I/O-bound

- A thread, in terms of behavior,  falls somewhere between two extremes: CPU-bound task and I/O-bound task.



**CPU-bound thread**:

- Spends most of its time performing computations, meaning its performance is largely determined by the speed of the processor. 
- These threads rarely wait for external events or I/O operations, so optimizing them usually involves improving algorithms or parallelizing work.

**I/O-bound thread** :

- Primarily waiting for input or output operations (such as disk reads/writes, network communication, or user interactions). 
- Their performance is constrained not by the CPU but by the speed of the I/O operations. 
- As a result, these threads often remain idle while waiting for data, and improving their performance typically involves using asynchronous I/O or optimizing how data is transferred.
