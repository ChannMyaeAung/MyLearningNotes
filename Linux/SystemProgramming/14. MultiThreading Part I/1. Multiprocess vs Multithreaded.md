# Multiprocess vs Multithreaded

## Example 1 - creation/destruction - process/thread

### Multiprocess

```c
#define NFORKS 600

void do_nothing()
{
    unsigned long f = 0xb00da;
}

int main()
{
    int pid, j, status;

    for (j = 0; j < NFORKS; j++)
    {
        switch (pid = fork())
        {
        case -1:
            perror("fork");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        case 0: // child
            do_nothing();
            exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
        default: // parent
            waitpid(pid, &status, 0);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ time ./final

real	0m2.308s
user	0m0.972s
sys	0m1.417s

```

- **real**: total wall-clock time spent
- **user**: time spend in user space
- **sys**: time spent in kernel space

### Multithreaded

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <strings.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <alloca.h>
#include <malloc.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/capability.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include "hello.h"

#define NTHREADS 600

void *do_nothing(void *data)
{
    unsigned long t = 0xb00da;
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

int main()
{
    int ret, i;
    pthread_t tid;
    pthread_attr_t attr;

    pthread_attr_init(&attr);
    pthread_attr_setdetachstate(&attr, PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED);

    for (i = 0; i < NTHREADS; i++)
    {
        ret = pthread_create(&tid, &attr, do_nothing, NULL);
        if (ret)
        {
            printf("pthread_create failed\n");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        // wait for the thread to terminate
        ret = pthread_join(tid, NULL);
        if (ret)
        {
            printf("pthread_join failed\n");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    }

    pthread_attr_destroy(&attr);
    pthread_exit(NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ time ./final
==43603==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: Joining detached thread, aborting.

real	0m0.007s
user	0m0.004s

```

- Creating and destroying a thread is much faster than creating and destroying a process.

## Why `fork(2)` is so much slower than `pthread_create(3)`?

- Linux makes heavy use of the performance-enhancing **copy-on-write (COW)** memory techniques within its internal implementation of `fork(2)`.
- If COW is heavily used, then what is slowing the fork down?
  - Answer: page table creation and setup cannot be COW-ed. It takes a while to do.
- When creating threads of the same process, this work is completely skipped.
- Not just multithreading, but multiprocessing (the use of fork to spawn multiple processes) is very helpful as well to gain higher throughput.
- After all, threads are far more efficient than processes in terms of creation and destruction.
- In a dynamic, unpredictable environment, where we do not know in advance how much work will be required, the use of multithreading to be able to quickly create worker threads (and quickly have them terminated) is very important.

## Notes

**Multiprocess:**

- Each process runs in its own separate memory space. Communication between processes requires explicit inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms (such as pipes, sockets, or shared memory). 
- This isolation enhances reliability and security, as a fault in one process is less likely to crash others. 
- However, the overhead is higher since processes are heavier weight and context switching between them is more costly.

**Multithreaded:**

- Multiple threads run within a single process and share the same memory space and resources. 
- This shared environment makes communication between threads simpler and faster, as they can directly access shared data. 
- On the downside, this requires careful synchronization (using mutexes, semaphores, etc.) to avoid race conditions and other concurrency issues. 
- Threads are lighter weight than processes, leading to lower overhead for context switching.
