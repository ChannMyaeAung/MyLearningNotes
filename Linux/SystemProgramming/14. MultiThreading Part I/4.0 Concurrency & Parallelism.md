# Concurrency vs. Parallelism

**Concurrency** and **parallelism** are related concepts in multithreading, but they have distinct meanings

- **Concurrency** means an application is making progress on multiple tasks at the same time (alternating between them). 

  - Even on a single CPU core, a multithreaded program can be concurrent: the operating system quickly switches between threads, giving the impression that tasks are running simultaneously. 
  - In reality, each thread runs for a timeslice one after another, but because the switching is frequent, the tasks *appear* to progress together.
  - Concurrency is about structure – our program has multiple logically independent threads of control that can interleave.

  

- **Parallelism** means two or more threads (or processes) are truly executing at the same time on different CPU cores (or different machines). 

  - Parallelism is about **execution** – doing multiple things *literally* at the same time. In a multi-core system, a multithreaded application can achieve parallelism by running threads on separate cores simultaneously. 
  - This is true hardware parallelism and can dramatically speed up CPU-bound workloads.
