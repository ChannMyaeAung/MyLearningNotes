# Context Switching

- It's meta-work that must be done every time the OS switches from running one process to running another process (voluntary and involuntary context switches).
- The actual amount of time it takes to context switch is highly dependent on the hardware system and software quality of the OS.

```sh
chan@CMA:~$ vmstat 3

- Under the `system` heading, two cols `in` (hardware interrupts) and `cs` (context switches) that have occurred in the last second.
- The numbers are fairly high which is why it does matter to system designers.
- Context switching between the threads of the same process takes a lot less work than between processes.
