# Stack location

- The stack of the main thread is always at the very top of the process VAS.
- The stacks of all other threads in the process are located somewhere between the process heap segment and the stack of main.
- The direction of growth of the stack segment is toward lower virtual addresses as the stack conform to the stack-grows-down semantic.
- By defaults, the system allocates the thread's stack.
- If we want to allocate the stack memory ourselves, we can use:
  - **`pthread_attr_setstack()`:** Specifies both the starting address and the size of the stack.
  - **`pthread_attr_getstack()`:** Retrieves the current stack's address and size.
