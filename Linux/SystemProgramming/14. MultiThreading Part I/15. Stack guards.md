# Stack guards

- A stack guard is a protected memory region at the end of the stack. 

- **Purpose:** to detect stack overflows by causing a segmentation fault if the guard region is overwritten.

- We can set or query this region using:

  - **`pthread_attr_setguardsize()`:** Sets the size of the guard area.

  - **`pthread_attr_getguardsize()`:** Retrieves the current guard size.
  - Setting an appropriate guard size helps catch and debug buffer overruns or runaway recursion.

- The guard region is an additional memory region allocated at the end of the thread stack for the number of bytes specified.
- The default guard size is the system page size.
- The guard size is an attribute of the thread and can thus only be specified at thread creation time.
