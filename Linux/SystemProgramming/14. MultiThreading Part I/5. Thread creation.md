# Thread creation

```c
#include <pthread.h>
int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine), void *arg);
```

- We need to include `-pthread` option in our makefile.
- On success, the new thread will be running concurrently (in parallel) with other threads that may be alive in that process.
  - The return value to `pthread_create(3)` is 0 on success and non-zero on failure. `errno` is set to a few values as appropriate.
- It will start running the `start_routine` func (3rd param).
  - It receives a void* pointer - a generic pointer enabling us to pass any value to the newly created thread.
- The new thread's thread ID will be stored in the opaque data item `thread` (1st param).
- The data type is `pthread_t` is opaque. We must not assume that it's an integer.
- The 2nd param (`attr`) is a thread attribute structure. Passing `NULL` here implies the library should use the default attributes when creating a new thread.

## Additional Notes

- When a new thread is created, it inherits certain attributes from its creating thread including:
  - The creating thread's capability sets.
  - The creating thread's CPU affinity mask (Linux-specific).
  - The signal mask.
- Any pending signals and pending timers (alarms) in the new thread are cleared.
- CPU execution times will be reset as well for the new thread.
- `pthread_create(3)` calls the `clone(2)` system call, which, within the kernel, actually creates the thread.
