# Thread stacks

**Thread Stack Size:**

- Every thread has its own stackâ€”the memory used for function calls, local variables, etc.

- All local variables declared within a thread function will remain private to that thread because they will reside in that thread's stack.

  - **`pthread_attr_setstacksize()`:** Sets a custom stack size for a new thread.

  - **`pthread_attr_getstacksize()`:** Retrieves the current stack size setting.
  - Both of these APIs have the phrase `_attr_` in them, implying that the stack size is actually set or queried from the thread attribute structure and not a live thread itself.
  - Thus, we can only set or query the stack size at the time of creation of the thread by setting up the attribute structure.
  - Once a thread is created, its stack size cannot be changed. The exception to this rule is the stack of the main thread.

- Adjusting the stack size is useful when the default size is insufficient for deep recursion or large local allocations.

- Whenever a context switch occurs, the **Stack Pointer (SP)** register is updated to point to the current thread's stack.
