# MultiThreading

- Multithreading applications means that their implementation uses multiple threads that run in parallel with each other.

- Recall: a thread is an independent execution (or flow) path within a process.
- In C, we have a single thread of execution: the `main()` func!
  - As it is where the execution beings and ends.
  - This model is called the single threaded software model.
- Each thread represents a separate path of execution, sharing the same memory space but operating independently. 
  - When a process creates a thread, the thread shares almost everything with all other threads of the same process - all of the VAS, thus the segments and all the data structures - except for a stack.
- This approach enables better resource utilization and responsiveness—for example: A program can perform background tasks (like I/O operations) while still keeping the user interface responsive. 
- Multithreading enables better CPU utilization by allowing different parts of a program to run simultaneously, reducing idle time and improving responsiveness.



## Example Scenario

- In interactive applications (like GUIs), multithreading keeps the interface responsive. 
- The main UI thread can handle user input while worker threads perform heavy computations or blocking tasks in the background. 
- This way, a long-running task (e.g. loading a file, spell-checking a document) won’t freeze the entire application. 
- The user can continue to interact with the app because other threads handle the time-consuming work. 
- In a single-threaded program, by contrast, any long task would block the main loop and make the app unresponsive until completion.



## **Key aspects:**

- **Concurrency**: Multiple threads can run concurrently, sharing computational work.

- **Parallelism**: On multi-core processors, threads can be executed truly in parallel.

- **Synchronization**: Threads often need to coordinate access to shared resources to avoid race conditions and inconsistencies.

- **Thread Management**: Creating, pausing, resuming, and terminating threads efficiently is crucial to optimizing performance.

## Additional notes

- Every thread has its own private stack segment.
- How large the thread stack? (typically 8MB on the Linux).
- The stack of `main()` always resides at the very top of the (user mode) virtual address space.
- They typically reside in the virtual memory space between the heap and the stack (of main).
- The only difference between a process and a thread is that of resource sharing. **Processes do not share, they copy; threads do share everything, except for the stack**.
- Both software and hardware state have to be maintained on a per thread basis. 
  - The Linux OS does exactly that: it maintains a per-thread task structure within the OS: the task structure contains all the process/thread attributes, including software and hardware context (CPU register values and so on).
