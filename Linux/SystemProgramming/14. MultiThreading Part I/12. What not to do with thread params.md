# Thread parameters - what not to do

- When passing a param to a thread rotine, we must guarantee that the param passed along is thread-safe (doesn't get modified in any manner while a thread or threads are using it).

```c
// Thread creation loop
    for (i = 0; i < NTHREADS; i++)
    {
        printf("main: creating thread #%ld ...\n", i);
        ret = pthread_create(&tid[i], &attr, worker, (void *)&i);
        ...
    }
```

- Passing the variable by address is unsafe because its value could change while it is being read as it being simultaneously written to by main.

**Soultion**:

```c
ret = pthread_create(&tid[i], &attr, worker, (*void *)i);
```

- Now each worker thread receives a copy of the loop index, thus eliminating any race, making it safe.
