# Orphans

1. Let's say: A process forks, the parent and child are alive and running their individual code paths in parallel. The parent PID is 100 and the child's is 102, implying the child's PPID is 100.
2. The parent process, for whatever reason, dies. The child continues on without any trouble except for a side effect.
3. The moment the parent (PID 100) dies, the child's PPID (100) is now invalid!
4. Thus the kernel intervenes, setting the child's PPID to the systemd, process! Its PID is by Unix convention, always the number 1.
5. The child that lost its immediate parent is now said to be re-parented by systemd (or init), and its PPID will thus be 1. 
6. This child is now an **orphan**.

**Note**: The child's PPID value abruptly changed, thus the systems programmer must ensure that they do not depend on the PPID value being the same for any reason.
