# Zombies

- When a child process terminates, it remains in the process table as a “zombie” until the parent process reads its exit status via a wait call. 
- Zombies are essentially dead processes that still occupy an entry in the process table (storing the exit status) because the parent hasn’t yet “reaped” them. 
- If a parent fails to wait for its children, these zombie processes accumulate, wasting system resources.
- The solution is to fix the code.
- To get rid of zombies, the parent must:
  - Call `wait()`, `waitpid()`, or `waitid()` to retrieve the child's termination status.
  - Optionally, install a SIGCHLD handler (or set `SIGCHLD` to `SIG_IGN` in some systems) that automatically reaps child processes.
  - When the parent process itself terminates, zombies are reparented to init (or systemd) which then reaps them.
