# Open files and security

- A key point again regarding security, for both the `exec` and `fork` scenarios. 
- When we perform an `exec` operation, the predecessor process's VAS is essentially overwritten by that of the successor process. 
- However, realize that the predecessor process's open files (held within the OS in a per-process structure called the **Open File Descriptor Table (OFDT)**) remain intact and are, in effect, inherited by the successor process. 
- This could pose a serious security threat. What if a security-sensitive file being used by the predecessor is not closed and an `exec` performed? 
- The successor now has access to it via its file descriptor, whether it exploits that knowledge or not. 
- The same argument holds true for the fork; if a parent process has a security-sensitive file open and then forks, the child too has access to the file (fork rule #6). 
- To counter this issue, the `open(2)` system call, includes a new flag: `O_CLOEXEC.` When this flag is specified within the `open(2)`, the corresponding file will be closed upon any future exec operation performed by that process. 
- When working with fork, the programmer must include logic to close any security- sensitive files in the parent prior to the fork.
