# `wait()` vs `waitpid()` vs `waitid()`

`wait()`, `waitpid()`, and `waitid()` are all used to wait for state changes in child processes, but they differ in functionality and the level of detail they provide:

- **wait():**
  - **Simplicity:** Waits for any child process to change state.
  - **Return Value:** Returns the PID of the terminated child and fills an integer status (typically parsed with macros like `WIFEXITED` and `WEXITSTATUS`).
  - **Limitation:** Offers minimal control—only one option to wait for any child.
- **waitpid():**
  - **Flexibility:** Allows waiting for a specific child (or a set of children) by specifying a PID (or special values like -1 to wait for any child).
  - **Options:** Supports options like `WNOHANG` for non-blocking behavior and `WUNTRACED` to report stopped children.
  - **Return Value:** Returns the child's PID and fills an integer status, similar to `wait()`, but with more control over which children to wait for.
- **waitid():**
  - **Detail and Granularity:** Instead of returning an integer status, it fills a `siginfo_t` structure, which provides more detailed information (such as exit status, signal number, and the child's PID in `si_pid`).
  - **Flexibility in Selection:** Allows specifying the type of children to wait for (e.g., a particular PID, any child, or a process group) through the `idtype` parameter.
  - **Options:** Offers fine-grained control via options that can filter events (e.g., waiting for children that have exited, stopped, or continued).
  - **No Return Value on Success:** Unlike `wait()`/`waitpid()`, it doesn’t return a PID; all relevant details are provided in the `siginfo_t` structure.

### Summary

- **wait()** is simple and waits for any child, returning minimal status information.
- **waitpid()** improves on this by allowing us to specify which child to wait for and offering non-blocking options, but still returns status as an integer.
- **waitid()** provides even more detailed information through a `siginfo_t` structure and finer control over the types of state changes we’re interested in, but it does so in a slightly different interface.
