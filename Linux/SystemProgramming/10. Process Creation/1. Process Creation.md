# Process creation

- Unix is a multitasking OS, programmers must exploit the OS's capabilities.
- To have an application multitask, we need to create multiple tasks, or processes.
- The `fork` is the Unix way to create a process.
- In fact, to the typical systems programmer, `fork` is the only way available to create a process.



- There is another system call to create a process or thread: `clone(2)`.
- It also creates a custom process. 
- It is not typically used by Linux application developers.
- Library typically the thread library developers use it more.
- `clone()` is very Linux-specific and non-portable.
- The other way to multitask is by multithreading.



## How `fork` works

- The job description of the `fork(2)` system call: create an identical copy of the calling process.
- The process-calling fork is called the **parent** and the newly created, newborn process is called the **child**.
- Fork is a system call. Thus, the real work of process creation is carried out by the OS under the hood.
- The **virtual address space (VAS)** of a process is built out of homogeneous regions called **segments or mappings**.
- When a child process is created, the OS will copy the parent's text, data (three of them), library (and other mappings), plus the stack segment to the child.
- However, there is **more to a process than just VAS**.
  - This includes open files, process credentials, scheduling information, filesystem structures, paging tables, namespaces( PIDs and so on), audit information, locks, signal handling information, timers, alarms, resource limits, IPC structures, profiling (perf) information, security (LSM) pointers, seccomp, thread stacks and TLS, hardware context (CPU and other registers), and so on.
- Performing a `fork` involves the **kernel copying several things from the parent to the child process**.
- Not all attributes are directly inherited by the child from the parent.



### Which attributes are inherited

- The following process attributes are inherited by the child process upon fork.
  - The **VAS**:
    - Text
    - Data:
      - Initialized
      - Uninitialized (bss)
      - Heap
    - Library segments
    - Other mappings (e.g, shared memory regions, mmap regions)
    - Stack
  - Open files
  - Process credentials
  - Scheduling information
  - Filesystem (VFS) structures
  - Paging tables
  - Namespaces
  - Signal dispositions
  - Resource limits
  - IPC structures
  - Profiling (perf) information
  - Security information:
    - Security (LSM) pointers
    - Seccomp
  - Thread stacks and TLS
  - Hardware context



### Which attributes aren't inherited

The following attributes of the parent process are not inherited by the child process upon forking:

- PID, PPID (parent's PID)
- Locks
- Pending and blocked signals (cleared for child)
- Timers, alarms (cleared for child)
- Audit information (CPU/time counters are reset for child)
- Semaphore adjustments made via `semop(2)`
- **Asynchronous IO (AIO)** ops and contexts
