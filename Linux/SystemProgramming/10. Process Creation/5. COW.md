# Copy-on-write (COW)

## Introduction

- Upon fork, the kernel copies all the parent's VAS segments plus all the other inherited process attributes to the new child process.
- In reality, attempting to do this would make `fork(2)` untenable as it would require too much RAM and too much time.
- One of the optimizations upon fork is that the kernel does not copy the text (code) segment into the child. It merely shares the parent's text segment (virtual) pages with the child process.
  - This works well, as text is in any case only readable and executable (r-x). Thus, it can never change, why make a copy?
- But what about the data and stack segments? Their pages are read-write(r-w) after all. So how can the OS just share them with the child?
  - That's where the COW semantics come in handy.
- To **understand COW**,  consider a single virtual page that has been marked as COW by the OS. 
- It essentially means: As long as both processes (parent and child) treat the page as read-only, they can share it. No copy is necessary.
- But the moment one of them modifies (even a byte in) the page, the OS intervenes and creates a copy of the page, which is then handed off to the process that performed the write.

## Definition

- Copy-on-Write (COW) is a memory management optimization technique commonly used in modern operating systems to delay and minimize the overhead of duplicating memory.

## How it works

- **Fork Optimization:**
  - When a process calls `fork()`, instead of immediately duplicating the entire memory space for the child process, the OS marks the parent's memory pages as read-only and shares them between the parent and child. 
  - Both processes reference the same physical pages.
- **On-Demand Copying:**
  - If either process attempts to modify a shared page, the OS triggers a page fault and then creates a separate copy of that page for the writing process.
  - This ensures that changes are isolated while avoiding unnecessary copying when pages are never modified.
- **Efficiency Gains:**
  - By using COW, systems save time and memory because most processes—especially shortly after a fork—tend not to modify large portions of their address space immediately. Only the pages that actually change are duplicated.

## Summary

In summary, COW improves performance and reduces memory usage by postponing and limiting the copying of data until it’s actually needed, making operations like `fork()` much more efficient.
