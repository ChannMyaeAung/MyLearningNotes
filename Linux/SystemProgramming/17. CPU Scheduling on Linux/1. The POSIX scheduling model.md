# The Linux OS and the POSIX scheduling model

- OSes maintain a construct called the **Kernel Schedulable Entity (KSE)**.
- The KSE is the granularity at which the OS scheduling code operates.
- The KSE on the Linux OS is a thread.
- All runnable threads compete for the CPU resource. 
- The kernel scheduler is ultimately the arbiter that decides which thread gets which CPU core and when.

---

## The Linux process state machine

- When a thread is newly created (either via the `fork()`, `pthread_create()` or `clone()` APIs), once the OS determines that the thread is fully born, it informs the scheduler of its existence by putting the thread into a runnable state.
- A thread in the `R` state is either actually running on a CPU core or is in the ready-to-run state.
- In both cases, the thread is enqueued on a data structure within the OS called a **run queue (RQ)**.
- The threads in the run queue are the valid candidates to run.
- No thread can possibly run unless it is enqueued on an OS run queue. 

---

## Linux CPU scheduling

- The process by which the kernel determines which runnable process or thread should use the CPU at any given time. 
- The scheduler is responsible for allocating CPU time fairly and efficiently based on various policies and priorities. 

Linux supports multiple scheduling policies:

- `SCHED_NORMAL` / `SCHED_OTHER`:
  - The default policy used for regular time-sharing tasks. 
  - It employs the **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)**, which uses a red-black tree to track processesâ€™ virtual runtimes. 
  - The task with the smallest virtual runtime (i.e., the one that has received the least CPU time relative to its weight) is chosen next.
- Real-Time Policies (`SCHED_FIFO` and `SCHED_RR`):
  - **`SCHED_FIFO` (First-In-First-Out):**
    A non-preemptive policy for real-time tasks where a task runs until it blocks, voluntarily yields, or is preempted by a higher-priority real-time task.
  - **`SCHED_RR` (Round Robin):**
    Similar to `SCHED_FIFO` but incorporates time slices to allow multiple tasks of the same priority to share the CPU.
- **`SCHED_DEADLINE`:**
  A policy designed for tasks with specific timing requirements or deadlines.

**Fairness and Efficiency:**

- **CFS** seeks to distribute CPU time fairly among processes based on their weights (which are derived from their nice values). 
- It ensures that even if some processes are CPU-intensive, every process gets a fair share of CPU time.
- For real-time tasks, priorities are absolute; higher-priority tasks preempt lower-priority ones.

**System Calls:**
Linux provides system calls like `sched_getscheduler()` and `sched_setscheduler()` to query and set the scheduling policy and parameters (such as priority) for a process.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Current scheduling policy: SCHED_OTHER (default time-sharing)
Failed to set SCHED_RR: Operation not permitted
```

- TO change the scheduling policty to `SCHED_RR`, we need to run the program with elevated privileges or grant the necessary capabilities to the executable.

```sh
sudo ./final
```
