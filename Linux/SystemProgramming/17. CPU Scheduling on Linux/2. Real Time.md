# Real time

- Real-time computing refers to systems that must process and respond to inputs within strict, predefined time constraints. 
- In these systems, it's not just about throughput or average performance—it’s about guaranteeing that critical tasks complete within a certain deadline.
- As long as a system can consistnently and without fail service the event within its given deadline, it's real time.
