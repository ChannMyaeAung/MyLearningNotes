# Real time

- Real-time computing refers to systems that must process and respond to inputs within strict, predefined time constraints. 
- In these systems, it's not just about throughput or average performance—it’s about guaranteeing that critical tasks complete within a certain deadline.
- As long as a system can consistently and without fail service the event within its given deadline, it's real time.

## Types of real time

- **Hard real-time systems**:
  - Missing a deadline is considered a system failure. 
  - A hard real time system requires a **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** to drive it.
  - Such systems are used in safety-critical applications (e.g., avionics, medical devices, trains, stock exchanges).
- **Soft real-time systems**:
  - deadlines are important but occasional misses may be tolerable, potentially degrading performance rather than causing outright failure. 
  - Multimedia systems are a common example. (smartphones, cameras, tablets).
- **Firm real-time systems**:
  - falls in-between hard and soft real-time ones.
  - The correctness of a computation depends not only on its logical accuracy but also on its timeliness. 
  - If a task’s result is delivered after its deadline, the output is considered useless—even if the computation is correct. 
  - However, unlike hard real-time systems where missing a deadline can lead to catastrophic failure, firm real-time systems tolerate occasional deadline misses by simply discarding the outdated result.

- The soft real-time scheduling policy design on Linux follows what is known as fixed priority preemptive scheduling.
- Fix priority implies that the application decides and fixed the thread priority and can change it, the OD does not.
