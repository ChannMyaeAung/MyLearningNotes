# `prlimit` utility

Besides using `ulimit`, another frontend to querying and displaying resource limits is the `prlimit` utility. 

- `prlimit` differs from `ulimit` in the following ways:
  - It's a newer, modern interface (Linux kernel version 2.6.36 onward)
  - It can be used to modify limits as required and launch another program that will inherit the new limits.
  - It's a binary executable program in itself, not a built-in like `ulimit` is.
- Without any parameters, `prlimit` displays the resource limits of the calling process (itself).

```sh
chan@CMA:~$ prlimit

- We can set the resource limits for max file size and max stack size of the preceding shell process

```sh
$ prlimit --pid=41909 --fsize=2048000 --stack=12582912
```
