# Under the hood, at the level of the kernel

- Within the Linux kernel, all task (process and thread) metadata is kept within a data structure called the `task_struct` (also known as the process descriptor). 
- The information on what Linux calls the security context of a task is kept within this task structure, embedded inside another data structure called **cred** (short for credentials). 
- This structure, **cred**, contains: 
  - The modern POSIX capabilities bitmasks (or capability sets) as well as 
  - The traditional-style process privileges: the RUID, EUID, RGID, EGID (as well as the `set[u|g]id` and `fs[u|g]id` bits).

- The procfs method actually looks up the credential information from here. 
- Hackers are obviously interested in accessing the **cred** structure and being able to modify it on the fly: filling it with zeros in the appropriate places gets them root! 

## A bit about `Procfs`

- `Procfs` (or the /proc filesystem) is a virtual, pseudo-filesystem in Linux that provides a window into the kernel and process information. 

### Brief Overview:

- **Virtual and Dynamic:**
  - Unlike traditional filesystems that store data on disk, procfs is generated on the fly by the kernel. 
  - Its files don't exist on disk—they’re created in memory as needed, which means the information is always current.
- **Hierarchical Structure:**
  - Procfs is typically mounted at `/proc`. 
  - Under this directory, we'll find a subdirectory for each running process (named by its process ID) that contains details such as process status, memory usage, open file descriptors, and more. 
  - In addition, there are files that provide system-wide information like CPU info, memory stats, and kernel parameters.
- **Usage:**
  - This filesystem is used by system utilities, administrators, and even scripts to monitor, debug, and manage the system. 
  - For example, commands like `ps`, `top`, and `free` derive their data from procfs.

In summary, procfs is an essential tool for accessing real-time system and process information in a simple, file-based interface.
