# Permission models layering

- The reality of a modern Linux kernel is that the legacy model is actually layered on top of the newer capabilities model.

| Pros and Cons             | Model/ Attributes                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Simpler, less secure      | UNIX Permissions, Process and File with UID, GID values embedded |
|                           | Process credentials: {RUID, RGID, EUID, EGID}                |
| More complex, more secure | POSIX Capabilities                                           |
|                           | Thread Capsets, File Capsets                                 |
|                           | Per Thread: {Inherited, Permitted, Effective, Bounded, Ambient} capsets <br/> Binary File: {Inherited, Permitted, Effective} capsets |

- **At the upper layer:** What appears as a single integer, the process UID and GID, is actually two integers under the hood - the real and effective user | group IDs.
- **Mid layer:** Giving rise to the four process credentials: {RUID, EUID, RGID, EGID}.
- **Bottom layer:** Which in turn is integrated on modern Linux kernels into the POSIX capabilities model:
  - All kernel subsystems and code now use the capabilities model to control and  determine access to an object.
  - Now root - the new "root", really is predicated on the capability bit `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` being set.
  - The `set*id()` system calls can be arbitrarily used to set real/effective IDs once the `CAP_SETUID` capability is present. Thus, we can make EUID = 0 and so on.
