# Embedding Capabilities into a program binary



## Program 1

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <sys/capability.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include "practice.h"

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, Linux System Programming, World!\n");
    pause();
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice &
[1] 11487
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ Hello, Linux System Programming, World!
```

## Program 2

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <strings.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <alloca.h>
#include <malloc.h>
#include <sys/capability.h>
#include "hello.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    pid_t pid;
    cap_t pcaps;
    char *caps_text = NULL;

    if (argc < 2)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s PID\n"
                        "PID: process to query capabilities of\n",
                argv[0]);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    pid = atoi(argv[1]);

    pcaps = cap_get_pid(pid);
    if (!pcaps)
    {
        perror("cap_get_pid");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    caps_text = cap_to_text(pcaps, NULL);
    if (!caps_text)
    {
        perror("cap_to_text");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf("\nProcess %6d: capabilites are: %s\n", pid, caps_text);
    cap_free(caps_text);

    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final 11487

Process  11487: capabilites are: =
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final 1

Process      1: capabilites are: =ep

```

- Our `pause` process (Program 1) is of course unprivileged, nor does it have any capabilities embedded within it; thus, as expected, we see it has no capabilities.
- Now we embed capabilities into our Program 1 binary executable file using `setcap()` utility:

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+ep ./practice
unable to set CAP_SETFCAP effective capability: Operation not permitted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+ep ./practice
[sudo] password for chan: 
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ ./practice &
[2] 12597
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/practice$ Hello, Linux System Programming, World!
```

- As `root` (technically, now we understand with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability), we of course have the `CAP_SETFCAP` capability, and thus succeed in using `setcap()`.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final 12597

Process  12597: capabilites are: cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw=ep

```

- Now the new Program 1 process indeed has the capabilities we wanted it to have.
- What happens if both the traditional setuid-root and the modern (file) capabilities are embedded in a binary executable? 
  - Well, in that case, when run, *only the capabilties embedded into the file* take effect; the process would have an EUID of 0, but would not have full root capabilities.



## Capability-dumb binaries

- Our Program  1 above really has no idea that it actually has these capabilities; in other words, it programmatically has done nothing to query or set POSIX capabilities on itself.
- Yet, via the file capabilities model (and the `setcap()` utility) we have "injected" capabilities into it. 
- This type of binary is therefore called a **capability-dumb binary**. 
- It's still vastly superior to doing a clumsy setuid-root security-wise, but it could get even "smarter" if the application itself programmaticallyâ€”used APIs to query and set capabilities upon itself at runtime. 
- We can think of this kind of app as a capability-smart binary.
- Often, when porting a legacy setuid-root (or worse, just a root) type of application, developers will strip it of the setuid-root bit, knock off root ownership from the binary and then convert it into a capability-dumb binary by running `setcap()`on it. 
- This is a good first step towards better security (or "hardening").



### Getcap and similar utilities

- The `getcap()` utility can be used to look up the capabilities embedded in a (binary) file. 

```sh
chan@CMA:~$ getcap /bin/bash
chan@CMA:~$ getcap /usr/bin/ping
/usr/bin/ping cap_net_raw=ep

```

- It's clear that bash does not have any file capsets. It runs with the normal privileges of the user who executes it.
- Ping, on the other hand, does, so that it can carry out its duties without requiring root privilege. The flags `ep` mean:
  - **e (effective):** When ping is executed, the **cap_net_raw** capability will be active in its effective set. This allows the program to perform operations (like creating raw sockets) that require this specific privilege.
  - **p (permitted):** The capability is also in the permitted set, which means that even if the effective set is modified at runtime, the process can add **cap_net_raw** back to its effective set if needed.
  - This assignment is done to allow ping to open raw network sockets (which are needed to send and receive ICMP packets) without requiring the binary to run with full root privileges, thereby following the principle of least privilege.
