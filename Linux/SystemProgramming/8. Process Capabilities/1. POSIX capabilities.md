# POSIX capabilities

How do we run the process which requires root. Without root privileges (no root login, setuid-root, or sudo allowed) and yet have it perform its tasks correctly?



Enter the POSIX Capabilities model:

- In this model, instead of giving a process blanket access as a root (or other) user, there is a way to embed particular capabilities into both the process and/or binary file.
- Every process, in fact every thread as part of its OS metadta, contains a bitmask. These are called the **capability bits** or the **capability set**, because each bit represents a capability.
- By carefully setting and clearing bits, the kernel (as well as the user space, if it has the capability) can therefore set **fine granularity permissions** on a per-thread basis.
  - For example, there is a capability bit called **CAP_DAC_OVERRID**; it would normally be cleared (0).
  - If set, then the process will bypass all the kernel's file permission checks - for anything: reading, writing and executing!
  - This is known as **DAC: Discretionary Access Control**.
- In effect, the capabilities model provides fine-grained permissions: a way to slice up the (overly) enormous power of the root user into distinct manageable pieces.

## Definition

POSIX capabilities allow a process to have a subset of the privileges traditionally reserved for the root user, thereby enabling more fine-grained control over what actions a process can perform. 

- Instead of granting full, all-powerful root access, capabilities split the superuser’s privileges into distinct units that can be independently enabled or disabled.

## Key Concepts

**Decomposition of Privileges:**

- Traditional Unix systems use an all-or-nothing model with root. 
- With capabilities, privileges such as binding to low-numbered ports (`CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`), overriding file permissions (`CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`), or modifying system settings (`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) are separated into individual bits. 
  - This means a process can be granted only the specific capabilities it needs, reducing the potential impact of a security breach.

**Capability Sets:**

(Note: **Linux capabilities** are the implementation of the broader **POSIX capabilities model** within the Linux kernel. In both cases, the idea is to split the traditional all-or-nothing root privilege into finer-grained units that can be independently enabled or disabled, allowing processes to perform specific privileged operations without needing full root access.)

Each process has several capability sets:

- **Permitted Set:** 
  - The total set of capabilities the process is allowed to use. 
  - The overall limiting superset of effective capabilities for the thread. 
  - If a capability is dropped, it can never be reacquired.
- **Effective Set:** 
  - A subset of permitted capabilities that are currently active. 
  - These are the capabilities actively used by the kernel when performing security checks. 
  - Only capabilities in the effective set can influence the outcome of permission checks during system calls.
- **Inheritable Set:** 
  - Capabilities that a process can pass on to its child processes during an `execve` call. 
  - When a process executes a new binary, the inheritable set (combined with any file capabilites) helps determine which capabilites the new process will have.
- **Bounding Set:** 
  - A limit on the capabilities that can ever be acquired by the process or its descendants.
  - Even if a capability is present in the permitted set, if it has been dropped from the bounding set, it cannot be reacquired.
- **Ambient Set:** 
  - A newer set (introduced in Linux 4.3) that allows selected capabilities to be preserved across execve calls under controlled conditions: even if the executable itself doesn’t have associated file capabilities. 
  - Ambient capabilities make it easier to build a semi-privileged environment for processes that need a limited set of privileges.
- File capabilities can also be assigned to executables so that when they are run, the process is automatically granted specific capabilities from its file’s permitted and effective sets. 
- This provides a finer level of privilege control without resorting to full setuid-root privileges.
- Together, these capability sets provide a more secure and flexible mechanism for managing process privileges in Linux. 
- They enable the principle of least privilege, where processes only have the specific permissions required for their tasks, reducing the potential damage if a process is compromised.

**Runtime Enforcement:**

- The Linux kernel checks these capability sets during system calls. 
- When a process attempts an operation that requires elevated privileges, the kernel verifies whether the process’s effective set includes the necessary capability. If not, the operation is denied.

**Tools for Managing Capabilities:**

- Utilities such as `setcap` and `getcap` allow administrators to assign or inspect capabilities on executables. 
- For example, setting a capability on a program might allow it to bind to a privileged port without running as the root user.

## Benefits

- **Improved Security:**
  - By granting only the minimum necessary privileges to each process, the attack surface is reduced. 
  - Even if a process is compromised, its ability to cause harm is limited by the specific capabilities it holds.
- **Fine-Grained Control:**
  - Administrators can tailor the privileges of processes to match their operational requirements, rather than relying on the blunt instrument of full root access.

## Summary

- POSIX capabilities in Linux represent a shift from the traditional all-or-nothing superuser model to a more nuanced and secure privilege management system. 

- They allow processes to perform necessary privileged operations without having complete root access, thereby enhancing overall system security.
