# Security Tips

- Do not use the now-outdated root mode any longer. This includes the (non) usage of setuid-root programs.
- Rather, one should use capabilities and assign only the required capabilities to the process:
  - directly or programmatically via the `libcap()` APIs ("capability-smart" binaries), or
  - indirectly via the `setcap()` file capabilities on the binary ("capability-dumb" binaries).
- If the above has been done via the API route, one should consider dropping capabilities immediately once the need for that capability is done. (and raising it only as and when required).
