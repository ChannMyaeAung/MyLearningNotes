# Virtual Address Space (VAS)

- Virtual address space is an abstraction provided by the operating system that gives each process its own isolated “view” of memory. 

- This abstraction decouples the memory addresses used by a program (virtual addresses) from the physical addresses in the computer’s RAM. Key points include:

- **Abstraction of Memory:**
  Each process is assigned a virtual address space that appears to be a contiguous block of memory. The operating system, through its memory management unit (MMU), translates these virtual addresses to physical addresses where the actual data is stored.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Isolation:** It prevents one process from inadvertently (or maliciously) accessing the memory of another, enhancing security and stability.
  - **Flexibility:** Programs can be written as if they have access to a large, continuous block of memory, even if the physical memory is fragmented or smaller.
  - **Support for Paging and Swapping:** Virtual memory allows the system to use techniques like paging, where parts of the memory can be moved to disk (swap space) when physical RAM is scarce. This means processes can use more memory than is physically available.

For example, even if a computer has 4 GB of RAM, a process might be given a 32-bit virtual address space (up to 4 GB) or even more on 64-bit systems, with the OS managing how this space maps onto the actual hardware.
