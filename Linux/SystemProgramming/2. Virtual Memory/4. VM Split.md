# VM Split

The term **VM split** (often referred to as the user/kernel split) describes how an operating system divides a process's virtual address space into two main regions:

1. **User Space:**
   - This is the portion of memory where user applications run.
   - It’s isolated from the operating system’s critical components to prevent accidental or malicious interference.
   - For example, on a typical 32-bit system, we might have 3GB dedicated to user processes.
2. **Kernel Space:**
   - This area is reserved for the operating system kernel, device drivers, and other core system components.
   - It is mapped into every process’s address space (for performance reasons) but with strict protection so that user-mode applications cannot access it directly.
   - Often, on a 32-bit system, the upper 1GB of the 4GB address space is reserved for the kernel.

### Why Use a VM Split?

- **Security and Stability:**
  By separating user processes from the kernel, the system prevents user-level bugs or malicious code from corrupting or accessing sensitive kernel memory.
- **Simplified Memory Management:**
  The operating system can manage memory more efficiently by applying different rules and protections to user space and kernel space.
- **Performance Considerations:**
  Mapping the kernel into every process’s address space can speed up system calls and context switches, while the split ensures that this performance benefit doesn’t come at the cost of compromising system integrity.
