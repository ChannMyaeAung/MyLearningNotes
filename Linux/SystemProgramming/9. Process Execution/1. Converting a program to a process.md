# Converting a program to a process

- A program is a binary file on a storage medium. By itself, it is a dead object.
- To run it and thus make it come alive into a process, we have to execute it.
- When we run a program from the shell, it does indeed come alive and become a process.

```sh
chan@CMA:~$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
  13127 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
  23396 pts/2    00:00:00 ps

```

- We run or execute the `ps` program; `ps` does run; it is now a process. It does its job printing out the processes currently alive in this terminal's session and then politely dies, leaving us back on the shell's prompt.
- The `ps` program become the `ps` process, some work process, some work probably had to be done by the OS.
- Indeed, that is the case, the OS executes a program and makes it a running process ultimately via an API, a system call, called the `execve()`.
