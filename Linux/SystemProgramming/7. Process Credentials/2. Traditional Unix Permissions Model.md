# Traditional Unix Permissions model

- The traditional Unix permissions model is a simple yet powerful system used to control access to files and directories. 

  

- It is based on the following key concepts:

  - **User, Group, and Others:**

    - Every file and directory is associated with an owner (user) and a group. Permissions are specified separately for:

      - **User (Owner):** The person who owns the file.

      - **Group:** A set of users that share certain privileges.

      - **Others:** Everyone else.

    

  - **Permission Types:**

    - For each of these categories, there are three basic permissions:

      - **Read (r):** Permission to view the contents of a file or list a directory's contents.

      - **Write (w):** Permission to modify a file or add/remove files in a directory.

      - **Execute (x):** Permission to run a file as a program or access a directory.

  - **Permission Representation:**

    - These permissions are often represented as a 10-character string (e.g., `-rwxr-xr--`), where:

      - The first character indicates the file type (e.g., `-` for a regular file, `d` for a directory).

      - The next three characters represent the user permissions.

      - The following three represent the group permissions.

      - The final three represent the permissions for others.

  - **Special Bits:**

    - In addition to the standard permissions, there are special permission bits:

      - **Setuid (Set User ID):** When set on an executable, it allows the program to run with the privileges of the file's owner.

      - **Setgid (Set Group ID):** Similar to setuid, but for group privileges.

      - **Sticky Bit:** Often used on directories (like `/tmp`) to ensure that only the file's owner (or root) can delete or rename files within that directory.

The Unix permissions model is enforced by the operating systemâ€™s kernel, ensuring that users can only perform actions on files and directories that they are authorized for. This model plays a crucial role in maintaining system security and file integrity.
