# What is a saved-set ID?

- A saved-set ID (often referring to the saved-set-user ID or saved-set-group ID) is part of a process’s credentials in Unix-like systems. 
- When a process is launched—especially via a setuid or setgid executable—the effective user or group ID is changed to that of the file’s owner or group, granting elevated privileges.
- However, the original effective ID is stored as the saved-set ID. This mechanism allows a process to:

- **Temporarily Drop Privileges:**
  - A process might intentionally drop its elevated privileges to perform safer operations under lower privileges.
- **Regain Privileges Later:**
  - If needed, the process can restore its elevated privileges by referencing the saved-set ID.



- This approach provides flexibility while maintaining security, ensuring that processes can minimize the risk of running with unnecessary elevated privileges while still having the ability to perform privileged operations when required.
