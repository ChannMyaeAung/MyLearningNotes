# Demand-paging

- We know that if a process dynamically allocates memory, `ptr = malloc(8192)`, then the process is now allocated 8 KB of physical RAM.
- But on modern OSes such as Linux, this is not actually the case.
- Realistically, all `malloc` does is reserve virtual pages of memory from the process VAS. So, when does the process get  the actual physical pages?
- When the process actually peeks or pokes any byte in a page, in reality when it makes any kind of access on any byte of the page (attempting to read/ write/ execute it), the process taps into the OS via a hardware exception called a page fault - and in the OS's fault handler, if all is well, the OS allocates a physical page frame for the virtual page.
- This highly optimized manner of handing out physical memory to process is called **demand-paging**. The pages are only physically allocated when they are actually required, on-demand.

## Definition

- By definition, Demand paging is a memory management strategy where pages of a program are not loaded into physical memory until they are actually needed during execution. 
- This “lazy loading” approach improves efficiency and resource utilization.

---

## Brief Explanation

**On-Demand Loading:**

- Rather than loading the entire program into RAM at startup, the operating system only loads the specific pages that a process accesses. 
- If a page is not used, it remains on disk.

**Page Fault Mechanism:**

- When a process tries to access a page that is not currently in memory, a page fault occurs. 
- The operating system then retrieves the required page from secondary storage (typically a hard drive or SSD) and loads it into RAM.

---

## **Benefits:**

- **Reduced Memory Usage:** Only necessary pages are loaded, which saves physical memory.
- **Faster Startup Times:** Since not all pages are loaded immediately, the program can begin executing more quickly.
- **Flexibility:** It allows systems to run larger programs than what could otherwise fit entirely into physical memory.

**Performance Considerations:**

- Although demand paging conserves memory and improves startup times, frequent page faults (especially if the working set of a process is larger than available memory) can slow down performance—a situation known as **thrashing**.

## Downside

- Imagine a scenario where several processes simultaneously performing large memory allocations.
- If all of them allocate large portions of virtual memory and then want to actually claim those pages physically at around the same time, this would put a tremendous amount of memory pressure on the OS.
- The OS makes absolutely no guarantee that it will succeed in servicing everyone.
- In the worst case, the Linux OS will run short of physical RAM to the extent that it must invoke the **Out-of-Memory (OOM)** Killer whose job is to identify the memory-hogging process and kill it and its descendants. Thus, reclaiming memory and keeping the system alive.

**Note:** By default, Linux follows an optimistic memory allocation strategy. This means that when `malloc()` returns non-NULL, there is no guarantee that the memory really is available. In case it turns out that the system is out of memory, one or more processes will be killed by the OOM killer.

## Resident of not?

- Now that we understand that pages allocated by `malloc` and friends are virtual and not guarantee to be backed by physical frames, imagine, we have a pointer to a (virtual) memory region and we know its length.
- We would now like to know whether the corresponding pages are in RAM, that is, whether they are resident of not.
- There is a system call available that gives precisely this information. `mincore(2)` (pronounced as m-in-core).

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>

int mincore(void *addr, size_t length, unsigned char *vec);
```

- Given the starting virtual address and length, `mincore(2)` populates the 3rd parameter - a vector array.
- After the call successfully returns, for every byte of the vector array, if the LSB (Least Significant Bit) is set, it implies that the corresponding page is resident (in RAM), otherwise it's not (possibly not allocated or in swap).
