## The program break

- When a process or thread wants memory, it invokes one of the dynamic memory routines - usually `malloc(3)` or `calloc(3)`; this memory is (usually) comes from the **heap segment**.
- The heap is a dynamic segment - it can grow toward higher virtual addresses.
- At any given point in time, the heap has an end point or top beyond which memory cannot be taken,
- This endpoint - the last legally reference-able location on the heap - is called the **program break**.
