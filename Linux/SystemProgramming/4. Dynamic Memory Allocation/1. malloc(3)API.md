# The malloc(3) API



```c
struct sbar
{
    int a[10], b[10];
    char buf[512];
} *psbar;

int main()
{
    psbar = malloc(sizeof(struct sbar));
    if (!psbar)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "malloc failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    free(psbar);
    return 0;
}
```



- `ltrace` is used to display all library APIs in the process-execution path. Similarly, we can use `strace` to trace all system calls.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ltrace ./final
malloc(592)                                      = 0x5fa5e1e882a0
free(0x5fa5e1e882a0)                             = <void>
+++ exited (status 0) +++

```

- We cal clearly see `malloc(3)` (and the fact that the structure we used took up 592 bytes on an x86_64), and its return value.
- It's important to understand that the **content** of the memory chunk allocated by `malloc(3)` is considered to be random.
- This, it's the programmer's responsibility to initialize the memory before reading from it.
- If we fail to do so, it results in a bug called **Uninitialized Memory Read (UMR)**.
- `malloc(3)` always returns a memory region that is aligned on a 8-byte boundary.



## malloc(3) - some FAQs

1. How much memory can `malloc(3)` allocate with a single call?

   - The parameter to `malloc(3)` is an integer value of the `size_t` data type, so logically, the maximum number we can pass as a parameter to `malloc(3)` is the maximum value a `size_t` can take on the platform.

   - On a 64-bit Linux, `size_t` will be 8 bytes, which in bits is 8 * 8 = 64. 

   - Therefore, the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated in a single `malloc(3)` call is 2<sup>64</sup>.

   - The amount of memory that can be allocated is limited by the amount of free memory contiguously available on the heap.

2. What if I pass `malloc(3)` a negative argument?

   - The data type of the parameter to `malloc(3), size_t`, is an unsigned integer quantity - it cannot be negative.

     ```c
     num = qa * qb;
     ```

   - What if `num` is declared as a signed integer variable and `qa` and `qb` are large enough that the result of the multiplication operation causes an overflow?

   - The `num` result will then wrap around and become negative!

   - `malloc(3)` should fail. However, if the `num` variable is declared as `size_t`, the negative quantity will turn into some positive quantity.

3.  What if I use `malloc(0)`?

   - Depending on the implementation, `malloc(3)` will return NULL, or, a non-NULL pointer that can be passed to free.
   - Even if the pointer is non-NULL, there is no memory, so best not attempt to use it.

4. What if I use `malloc(2048)` and attempt to read/write beyond 2048 bytes?

   - This is a bug - an out-of-bounds memory access bug, further defined as a read or write buffer overflow.



## The free API

```c
void free(void *ptr);
```

- It accepts one parameter: the pointer to the memory chunk to be freed. `ptr` must be a pointer returned by one of the `malloc(3)` family routines: `malloc(3)`, `calloc` , or `realloc[array]`.
- Once a memory chunk is freed, we obviously cannot attempt to use any part of that memory chunk again; doing so will result in a bug or what's called **UB - undefined behavior**.
- Calling `free(ptr)` does not set `ptr` to `NULL`.



## The calloc API

- Almost identical to `malloc(3)`, differing in two main aspects:
  - It initializes the memory chunk it allocates to the zero value (that is, ASCII 0 or NULL, not number 0).
  - It accepts two parameters, not one.

```c
void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);
```

- `nmemb` is n members.
- `size` is the size of each member.
- `calloc(3)` allocates a memory chunk of (`nmemb * size`) bytes.
- So if we want to allocate memory for an array of 1000 integers, we can do like this:

```c
int *ptr;
ptr = calloc(1000, sizeof(int));
```

- Assuming the size of an integer is 4 bytes, we would have allocated a total of (1000 * 4) = 4000 bytes.
- Whenever we require memory for an array of items (a frequent use case in applications is an array of structures), `calloc` is a convenient way to both **allocate and simultaneously initialize the memory**.



## The realloc API

- Is used to resize an existing memory chunk to grow or shrink it.
- This resizing can only be performed on a piece of memory previously allocated with one of the `malloc(3)` family of APIs.

```c
void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
```

- `ptr` is a pointer to a chunk of memory previously allocated with one of the `malloc(3)` family of APIs.
- `size` is the new size of the memory chunk.
- It can be larger or smaller than the original, thus growing and shrinking the memory chunk.

```c
int main()
{
    void *ptr, *newptr;
    ptr = calloc(100, sizeof(char));
    assert(ptr != NULL);
    newptr = realloc(ptr, 150);
    if (!newptr)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "realloc failed!\n");
        free(ptr);
        exit(1);
    }
    free(newptr);
    return 0;
}
```

```sh

```

- The pointer returned by `realloc` is the pointer to the newly resized chunk of memory.
- It may or may not be the same address as the original `ptr`.
- If it fails, the return value is NULL, and the original memory chunk is left untouched.
- The pointer returned by `realloc(3)`, `newptr`, is the one that must be subsequently freed, not the original pointer (`ptr`) to the (now resized) memory chunk.
- One should not attempt to free both pointers, as that to is a bug.



## The reallocarray API

- We allocate memory for an array using `calloc(3)`, later we want to resize it to be a lot larger.

```c
struct sbar *ptr, *newptr;
ptr = calloc(1000, sizeof(struct sbar));
newptr = realloc(ptr, 500 * sizeof(struct sbar));
```

- There's easier way using `reallocarray(3)`.

```c
void *reallocarray(void *ptr, size_t nmemb, size_t size);
```

The code becomes simpler

```c
newptr = reallocarray(ptr, 500, sizeof(struct sbar));
```

- `reallocarray` has one real advantage over `realloc` - safety.
- Unlike `realloc()` call, `reallocarray()` fails safely in the case where the multiplication would overflow. If such an overflow occurs, `reallocarray()` returns NULL, sets `errno` to `ENOMEM`, and leaves the original block of memory unchanged.



## How `malloc(3)` really behaves

- All `malloc(3)` family APIs obtain their memory from the heap segment.
- But it's not always the case.
- The modern glibc `malloc(3)` engine uses some subtle strategies to make the most optimal use of available memory regions and the process VAS.
- The library uses a predefined `MMAP_THRESHOLD` variable - Its value is 128 KB by default - to determine from where memory gets allocated.
- Let's say we are allocating `n` bytes of memory with `malloc(n)`:
  - If n < `MMAP_THRESHOLD`, use the heap segment to allocate the requested `n` bytes.
  - If n >= `MMAP_THRESHOLD`, and if `n` bytes are not available on the heap's free list, use an arbitrary free region of virtual address space to satisfy the requested `n` bytes allocation.

#### Output #1

                              init_brk =   0x5a39bcf84000
 #: malloc(       n) =        heap_ptr           cur_brk   delta [cur_brk-init_brk]

 1: malloc(    4083) =   0x5a39bcf846d0    0x5a39bcfa5000 [135168]
 2: malloc(       3) =   0x5a39bcf856d0    0x5a39bcfa5000 [135168]

```

- The process prints out its initial program break value: `0x5a39bcf84000`.
- It then allocates just 8 bytes (via the `malloc(3)` API). Under the hood, the glibc allocation engine invokes the `sbrk(2)` system call to grow the heap.
- The new break is now `0x5a39bcf846b0`, an increase of 135168 bytes = 132 KB from the previous break.
- Why? Optimization: glibc anticipates that, in the future, the process will require more heap space. Instead of the expense of invoking a system call(`sbrk/brk`) each time, it performs one large heap-growing operation.
- The next two `malloc(3)` APIs from the above output (number 1 and 2) prove this is the case.
- We allocate 4083 and 3 bytes respectively. The program break does not change - the heap is already large enough to accommodate the request.

max mmap regions =          0
max mmap bytes   =          0

```

- The output is similar, except the program invokes the usual `malloc_stats(3)` API, which queries and prints `malloc(3)` state information to `stderr`.
- From this output, we can notice that:
  - The available free memory - system bytes - is 132 KB (after performing a tiny 8 byte `malloc(3)`)
  - In-use bytes increases with each allocation but system bytes remains the same
  - `mmap` regions and `mmap` bytes is zero as no mmap-based allocations have occurred.



#### Output #3

- This time, we pass the `2` parameter, asking the program to perform larger allocations greater than `MMAP_THRESHOLD`.

```

- Now we allocate 132 KB.
- The allocations (#3 and #4) are for 132 KB and 1 MB - both above the `MMAP_THRESHOLD` (value of 128 KB).
- The (arena 0) heap in-use bytes (5856) has not changed at all across these two allocations ,indicating the heap memory has not been used.
- The max `mmap` regions and max `mmap` bytes numbers have changed to positive values (from zero), indicating the use of `mmap-ed` memory.



## Where does freed memory go?

- It does not get freed back to the system, but rather to the process heap (which, of course, is virtual memory).
- However, there are at lease two cases where this may not occur:
  - If the allocation was satisfied internally via `mmap` rather than via the heap segment, it gets immediately freed back to the system.
  - On modern glibc,if the amount of heap memory being freed is very large, this triggers the return of at least some of the memory chunks back to the OS.
