### Process vs. Thread

**Processes:**

- **Definition:**
  A process is an independent execution unit that includes its own virtual address space, system resources (such as open files, environment variables), and security context.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Isolation:** Processes are isolated from one another, which means that a bug in one process is less likely to affect others.
  - **Resource Ownership:** Each process has its own resources and memory, which typically leads to higher overhead when creating and switching between processes.
  - **Scheduling:** The operating system schedules processes independently. When a process is created, it gets a fresh copy of the environment it needs, often through a system call like `fork()` in Unix-like systems.

**Threads:**

- **Definition:**
  A thread is a smaller, lightweight unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads within the same process share the same virtual address space and resources.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Shared Memory:** Threads within the same process can communicate more easily because they share the same memory, but this also means that synchronization (using locks, semaphores, etc.) is necessary to avoid conflicts.
  - **Lower Overhead:** Creating and switching between threads is generally less resource-intensive than doing so with full-blown processes, which makes threads ideal for tasks requiring high concurrency.
  - **Cooperative Execution:** While threads run independently, they are tightly coupled with their parent process. A crash in one thread (if not properly handled) can affect the entire process.

**Key Differences Summarized:**

- **Memory and Resource Isolation:**
  - *Processes* are isolated; they do not share memory by default.
  - *Threads* share the same memory and resources, facilitating inter-thread communication but also requiring careful synchronization.
- **Creation and Overhead:**
  - *Processes* have higher overhead due to separate memory allocation and resource management.
  - *Threads* are lighter weight and easier to create and manage within the same process context.
- **Fault Tolerance:**
  - A fault in one process generally does not impact others.
  - A fault in one thread can potentially crash the entire process if not managed correctly.

------

### Summary

**Process vs. Thread:**
Processes are independent execution entities with separate memory spaces and higher overhead, while threads are lightweight units within a process that share the same memory, offering efficient concurrency at the cost of needing careful synchronization.
