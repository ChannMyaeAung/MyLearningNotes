# Memory Protection

## Definition

- By definition, Memory protection is a core concept in system programming that ensures each process can only access the memory regions it is authorized to use. 
- This isolation prevents processes from inadvertently or maliciously interfering with each other's memory, thereby enhancing both system stability and security.

---

## Key Points on Memory Protection

**Access Rights:**

- Memory regions are marked with specific access rights such as read, write, and execute. 
- The operating system enforces these permissions to control which operations are allowed on a given region.

**Protection Mechanisms:**

- Operating systems use hardware support (e.g., MMUâ€”Memory Management Unit) along with system calls like `mprotect` to change the protection of a memory region.
- This can be used to mark memory as read-only, no-access, or executable, among other settings.

### **Use Cases:**

- **Security:** Preventing code execution in data segments (a technique to mitigate buffer overflow attacks).
- **Stability:** Avoiding accidental writes to code segments or shared data regions.
- **Debugging:** Catching illegal memory access bugs early by triggering a segmentation fault when a program violates memory protection rules.

## `mprotect(2)`

```c
#include <sys/mman.h>
int mprotect(void *addr, size_t len, int prot);
```

- Starting at the virtual address, `addr`, for `len` bytes (that is from `addr` up to `addr + len - 1`), apply the memory protections specified by the `prot` bitmask.
- As the granularity of `mprotect` is a page, the first parameter, `addr`, is expected to be page-aligned.
- The 3rd parameter, `prot`, is where we specify the actual protections.
  - It is a bitmask and can either be just the `PROT_NONE` bit or the bitwise OR of the remainder:

| Protection bit | Meaning of memory protection       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `PROT_NONE`    | No access allowed on the page      |
| `PROT_READ`    | Reads allowed on the page          |
| `PROT_WRITE`   | Writes allowed on the page         |
| `PROT_EXEC`    | Execute access allowed on the page |

## C Code Example

```c
int main()
{
    // Determine the page size
    size_t size = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);

    // Allocate one page of memory using mmap
    char *addr = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);

    if (addr == MAP_FAILED)
    {
        perror("mmap");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Write some data into the allocated memory
    strcpy(addr, "Hello, Memory Protection!");
    printf("Before mprotect: %s\n", addr);

    // Change the memory protection to read-only
    if (mprotect(addr, size, PROT_READ) == -1)
    {
        perror("mprotect");
        munmap(addr, size);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Attempting to write to this read-only region will cause a segmentation fault
    printf("Attempting to modify read-only memory...\n");
    addr[0] = 'h'; // this will cause a segmentation fault

    // clean up the allocated memory
    munmap(addr, size);
    return 0;
}
```

##### Explanation

1. **Memory Allocation:**
   The code uses `mmap` to allocate one page of memory with both read and write permissions.
2. **Data Writing:**
   It writes a string into this allocated memory and prints it.
3. **Changing Protection:**
   The `mprotect` system call is then used to change the protection of the allocated memory region to read-only (`PROT_READ`). Once this change is made, any write operation to this memory will cause a segmentation fault.
4. **Fault Trigger:**
   The attempt to modify the first byte of the memory (i.e., `addr[0] = 'h';`) is expected to fail because the memory is now read-only.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Before mprotect: Hello, Memory Protection!
Attempting to modify read-only memory...
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
