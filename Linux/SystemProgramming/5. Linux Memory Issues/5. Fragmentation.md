# Fragmentation

- Memory fragmentation in Linux refers to the inefficient utilization of memory that can occur when free memory is split into small, noncontiguous blocks. 

- This phenomenon comes in two primary forms:

  - **External Fragmentation:**
    - Over time, as processes allocate and free memory of varying sizes, free memory may become divided into many small chunks. 
    - Even if the total free memory is sufficient, these chunks might not be large enough to satisfy a new, larger allocation request. 
    - Linux uses techniques like the buddy allocator and memory compaction (for kernel memory) to mitigate this issue.
  - **Internal Fragmentation:**
    - This happens when memory allocations are rounded up to fixed block sizes, causing some of the allocated memory to remain unused. 
    - The unused portion inside these blocks is wasted space, leading to inefficiencies in memory usage.

  

  Overall, while fragmentation can affect system performance by increasing the difficulty of allocating large contiguous memory regions, Linuxâ€™s memory management subsystems (e.g., the buddy system and slab allocator) are designed to reduce fragmentation and make efficient use of available memory.
