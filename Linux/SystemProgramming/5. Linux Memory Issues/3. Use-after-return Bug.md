# Use-after-return (UAR)

## Test Case

- This one involves returning a storage item (or pointer to it) to the calling function.
- The issue is that the storage is local or automatic, thus implying that once the return is affected, the storage object is now out of scope.

```c
static void *uar(void)
{
    char name[32];
    memset(name, 0, 32);
    strncpy(name, "Be as an owl on the hunt!", 22);

    return name;
}

int main()
{

    void *res = uar();
    printf("res: %s\n", (char *)res);
    return 0;
}
```

- We allocate 32 bytes to a local variable, initialize it and return it to the caller.
- Once the return statement in the `uar()` function takes effect, the `name` variable is automatically out of scope.
- Therefore, the pointer to it is invalid, and when run, it fails.
- There are times when this bug escapes notice. It looks like it works fine and there's no bug.
  - This is because there is no actual guarantee that the stack memory frame is immediately destroyed upon function return - memory and compiler optimization might keep the frame around.
  - Nevertheless, it's a dangerous bug and must be fixed!

```



## Test Case #2

```c
int *getLocalValue()
{
    int local = 42; // local variable on the stack
    return &local;  // BUG: returning address of a local variable
}

int main()
{
    int *ptr = getLocalValue();
    // the following access is undefined behavior because 'ptr' refers to memory that is no longer valid.
    printf("Value: %d\n", *ptr);
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- In the function `getLocalValue()`, the variable `local` is allocated on the stack.
- When `getLocalValue()` returns, the stack frame is popped, and the memory for `local` is reclaimed.
- The returned pointer (`ptr`) in `main()` then points to a memory location that is no longer valid, leading to a use-after-return bug (undefined behavior when dereferenced).

Below output involves testing the program with valgrind.
