# Use-after-free bug

- Operating upon a memory pointer after it has been freed up is obviously a bug, causing undefined behavior.
- The pointer is sometimes called a dangling pointer.



```c
static void uaf(void)
{
    char *arr, *next;
    char name[] = "Be as an owl on the hunt!";
    int n = 512;

    arr = malloc(n);
    if (!arr)
    {
        perror("malloc");
        exit(1);
    }

    memset(arr, 'a', n);
    arr[n - 1] = '\0';
    printf("%s():%d: arr = %p%.*s\n", __FUNCTION__, __LINE__, arr, 32, arr);

    next = malloc(n);
    if (!next)
    {
        perror("malloc");
        exit(1);
    }
    free(arr);
    strncpy(arr, name, strlen(name)); // BUG: UAF

    printf("%s():%d: arr = %p%.*s\n", __FUNCTION__, __LINE__, arr, 32, arr);
    free(next);
}

int main()
{
    uaf();
    return 0;
}
```

- Neither at compile-time nor at runtime is the UAF bug detected, nor does it cause a crash.
- `"%.*s"` format is used to print a string of a specific length (no terminating null required!). 
- First specify the length in bytes to print, and then the pointer to string.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
uaf():31: arr = 0x56c7495e52a0aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
uaf():42: arr = 0x56c7495e52a0Be as an owl on the hunt!aaaaaaa

```
