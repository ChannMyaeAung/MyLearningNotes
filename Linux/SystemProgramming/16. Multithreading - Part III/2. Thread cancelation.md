# Thread cancelation and cleanup

- The pthreads design provides a sophisticated framework for achieving two other key
  activities for a robust multithreaded application: 
  - The ability to have a thread in the
    app cancel (effectively, kill) another thread, and 
  - The ability to have a thread that is
    either terminated normally (via the pthread_exit(3)) or abnormally (via
    cancelation) be able to perform the required resource cleanup.

## Canceling a thread

- Thread cancellation is a mechanism in pthreads that allows one thread to request the termination of another thread. 
- The target thread must be in a cancelable state and typically checks for cancellation requests at cancellation points. 
- By default, cancellation is deferred, meaning the thread will only act on the cancellation request when it reaches a cancellation point (such as sleep, blocking I/O calls, or explicit checks with `pthread_testcancel()`). 
- Additionally, cleanup handlers can be registered to ensure that necessary cleanup is performed when a thread is canceled.

```c
int pthread_setcancelstate(int state, int *oldstate);
int pthread_setcanceltype(int type, int *oldtype);
```

- Two possible cacelability states for `pthread_setcancelstate`:
  - `PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE` (default on creation)
  - `PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE`
- Two possible cacelability states for `pthread_setcancelstate`:
  - `PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED` (default on creation)
  - `PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS`
- The previous cancelability type will be returned in the second param, `oldtype`.

// Cleanup function to release resources if needed.

}

// Thread function that is cancelable.

    (void)arg; // Unused parameter

    // Enable cancellation and set it to deferred mode.
    pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE, NULL);
    pthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, NULL);

    printf("Thread started and is cancelable.\n");

    // Register a cleanup handler. This handler will be executed if the thread is canceled.
    pthread_cleanup_push(cleanup, NULL);

    // Run an infinite loop with cancellation points.
    while (1)
    {
        printf("Thread working...\n");
        // sleep() is a cancellation point.
        sleep(1);
        // Optionally, we can use pthread_testcancel() to explicitly check for cancellation.
    }

    // This macro is paired with pthread_cleanup_push, but in our infinite loop it is never reached.
    pthread_cleanup_pop(1);
    return NULL;
}

int main(void)
{
    pthread_t thread;

    // Create the cancelable thread.
    if (pthread_create(&thread, NULL, cancelable_thread, NULL) != 0)
    {
        perror("pthread_create");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Let the thread run for a few seconds.
    sleep(3);

    // Request cancellation of the thread.
    printf("Main thread: Canceling the worker thread.\n");
    if (pthread_cancel(thread) != 0)
    {
        perror("pthread_cancel");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Wait for the thread to finish and clean up.
    if (pthread_join(thread, NULL) != 0)
    {
        perror("pthread_join");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Main thread: Worker thread has been canceled.\n");

    return 0;
}

```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Thread started and is cancelable.
Thread working...
Thread working...
Thread working...
Main thread: Canceling the worker thread.
Cleanup: releasing resources
Main thread: Worker thread has been canceled.
```

- How does the main thread know that the target thread has actually terminated?
- The main thread is expected to join upon all threads, hence, the target thread upon termination will get joined.
