# Thread safety

- A thread-safe, or as the man pages like to specify it, MT-Safe, function or API is one that can be safely executed in parallel by multiple threads with no adverse issue.
- In a thread-safe design, access to shared resources is controlled so that simultaneous operations by different threads do not interfere with each other.

## Reentrant-safe vs thread-safe

- Reentrant safety is an older issue prior to the advent of multitasking and multithreading OS.
  - It should only use local variables or have the ability to save and restore the global it uses such that it's safe.
- Thread safety is a much more recent issue. We are referring to modern OSes that are multithreaded-capable.
  - A func that is thread-safe can be invoked in parallel from multiple threads. (running on multiple CPU cores perhaps) simultaneously without breaking it.
- In short, reentrant safety is concerned with one thread re-invoking a function while an active invocation still exists. Thread safety is concerned with multiple threads - concurrent code - executing the same function in parallel.
