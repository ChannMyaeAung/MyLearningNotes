# Reader-Writer Lock

- A reader-writer lock (or shared-exclusive lock) allows multiple threads to read a shared resource concurrently (shared mode) while ensuring that writes are exclusive. 
- When a thread needs to write, it must acquire the lock in write mode, which blocks both other writers and readers. 
- This design optimizes performance in scenarios where read operations are frequent and writes are infrequent, as it permits high concurrency for readers while still protecting the resource during modifications.

---

## Code Example

- Multiple readers can hold the lock concurrently, but writers require exclusive access.
- The writer thread acquires the write lock and holds it exclusively for 2 seconds. 
- Meanwhile, reader threads, which require a shared read lock, will wait until the writer releases the lock. 
- Once the writer finishes, the readers acquire the lock concurrently.
