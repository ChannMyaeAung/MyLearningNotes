# Mutex attributes

- A mutex can be one of four types.
- The type of mutex used affects the behavior of the lock and unlock.
- The types are:
  - `PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL`
  - `PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK`
  - `PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE`
  - `PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT`
- If a thread attempts to relock a mutex that it has already locked, `pthread_mutex_lock(3)` will behave as described in the "relock" column of the following table. 
- If a thread attempts to unlock a mutex that it has not locked or a mutex which is unlocked, `pthread_mutex_lock(3)` will behave as "Unlock When Not Owner".

| Mutex Type | Robustness | Relock             | Unlock When Not Owner |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| NORMAL     | non-robust | deadlock           | undefined behavior    |
| NORMAL     | robust     | deadlock           | error returned        |
| ERRORCHECK | either     | error returned     | error returned        |
| RECURSIVE  | either     | recursive          | error returned        |
| DEFAULT    | non-robust | undefined behavior | undefined behavior    |
| DEFAULT    | robust     | undefined behavior | error returned        |

- The pair of APIs to get and set a mutex's type attribute

```c
#include <pthread.h>
int pthread_mutexattr_gettype(const pthread_mutexattr_t *restrict attr, int *restrict type);
int pthread_mutexattr_settype(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr, int type);
```
