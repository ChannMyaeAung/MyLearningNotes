# Concurrency and atomicity

- Concurrent execution implies that multiple threads can run truly in parallel on multiple CPU cores. 
- When this happens on text (code), it's good; we get higher throughput. 
- However, the moment we run concurrently while working on shared writable data, we will have a problem with data integrity. 
  - Because text is read- only (and executable), whereas data is read-write. 
  - What we would really like, of course, is to be greedy and have the best of both worlds: execute code concurrently via multiple threads, but the moment we must work on shared data, stop the concurrency (parallelism), and have just one thread run through the data section sequentially until it's done, then resume parallel execution.

- **Atomicity** is about the indivisibility of operations. 
  - One that either completes entirely or not at all—there’s no intermediate state visible to other threads. 
  - Guarantees that when multiple threads perform operations on shared data, each operation is completed without interference, preventing race conditions. 
    - For example, an atomic increment of a shared counter ensures that even if multiple threads try to update it at the same time, each update is applied fully without any partial updates.

In summary, while concurrency deals with the simultaneous progress of multiple tasks, atomicity ensures that operations on shared resources occur safely and completely, even in a concurrent environment.
