# Locking guidelines

- **Keep locking granularity fine enough**: lock data, not code.
- **Simplicity is key**: Complex scenarios involving multiple locks and threads lead to not just performance issues (extreme case being deadlock), but also to other defects.
-  **Keep Lock Scope Minimal:** Hold locks only as long as necessary. Avoid performing lengthy operations or blocking calls while holding a lock. 
  - Using a timeout in conjunction with the lock is one way to alleviate this.
- **Consistent Lock Ordering:**Always acquire multiple locks in a fixed, predetermined order. 
  - Helps prevent circular waiting, which can lead to deadlocks.
- **Avoid Nested Locks:** Minimize the use of nested locks. If one must nest locks, document and adhere to a strict lock hierarchy to reduce the risk of deadlock.
- **Regularly Test and Profile:** Use tools like thread sanitizers and profilers to detect deadlocks, race conditions, or contention issues during development and testing.
