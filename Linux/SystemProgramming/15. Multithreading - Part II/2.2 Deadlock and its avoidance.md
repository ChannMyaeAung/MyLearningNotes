# Deadlock and its avoidance

- Occurs when two or more threads or processes are each waiting for the other to release a resource, resulting in a standstill where none can proceed. 
- Each participant is holding one resource while waiting for another that’s held by someone else.

## Common deadlock types

### Self deadlock (relock)

- Occurs when a thread attempts to re-lock a mutex it already holds. 
- For non-recursive (normal) mutexes, re-acquiring the lock in the same thread causes the thread to block waiting for itself, which never happens resulting in a deadlock within the same thread.

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <strings.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <alloca.h>
#include <malloc.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/capability.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include "hello.h"

pthread_mutex_t lock;

void *self_deadlock(void *arg)
{
    (void)arg;
    pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
    printf("Thread acquired lock first time.\n");
    // Attempting to lock the same mutex again causes self-deadlock because the mutex is non-recursive.
    pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
    printf("This line will never be printed.\n");
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
    return NULL;
}

int main(void)
{
    pthread_t thread;
    pthread_mutex_init(&lock, NULL);
    pthread_create(&thread, NULL, self_deadlock, NULL);
    pthread_join(thread, NULL);
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&lock);
    return 0;
}

```

- The first `pthread_mutex_lock(&lock)` call succeeds, and the thread prints "Thread acquired lock first time."
- The second `pthread_mutex_lock(&lock)` call causes a deadlock because the mutex is non-recursive,meaning a thread cannot lock it again without first unlocking it.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Thread acquired lock first time.
^C

```



### The ABBA deadlock

- Two (or more) threads get into a circular wait by acquiring locks in conflicting orders (e.g., one holds A and waits for B while the other holds B and waits for A).

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <strings.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <alloca.h>
#include <malloc.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/capability.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include "hello.h"

pthread_mutex_t mutexA;
pthread_mutex_t mutexB;

void *thread1(void *arg)
{
    (void)arg;
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutexA);
    printf("Thread1 acquired mutexA.\n");
    sleep(1); // Give time for thread2 to lock mutexB.
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutexB);
    printf("Thread1 acquired mutexB.\n");
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutexB);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutexA);
    return NULL;
}

void *thread2(void *arg)
{
    (void)arg;
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutexB);
    printf("Thread2 acquired mutexB.\n");
    sleep(1); // Give time for thread1 to lock mutexA.
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutexA);
    printf("Thread2 acquired mutexA.\n");
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutexA);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutexB);
    return NULL;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Thread1 acquired mutexA.
Thread2 acquired mutexB.
^C
```

- Both threads are waiting for each other to release the mutex they need, resulting in a deadlock. Neither thread can proceed, and the program is stuck.

---

## Avoiding deadlock

- **Consistent Lock Order**: To fix the deadlock, we must ensure that both threads acquire the mutexes in the same order. 
  - In the preceding example of ABBA deadlock, we can make it so that both threads acquire `mutextA` first and then `mutexB`. It now prevents deadlock.
  - If all threads request locks in the same sequence, circular wait is eliminated.
- **Avoid Nested Locks:** Try to design one's code so that a thread doesn’t need to hold multiple locks simultaneously.
- **Lock Timeout and Try-Lock:** Use timeouts or non-blocking lock attempts (like try-lock mechanisms). 
  - If a thread can’t acquire a lock quickly, it can back off or roll back its actions, avoiding long waits.
