# Interrupted system calls and how to fix them with the `SA_RESTART`

- Traditional (older) Unix OSes suffered from an issue regarding the handling of signals while processing blocking system calls.
- When a process is executing a system call (for example, reading from a file or socket) and a signal is delivered, the system call may be interrupted—returning an error (typically, EINTR). 
  - Means the system call did not complete its intended work, and our program must handle this situation (usually by restarting the call).
- The `SA_RESTART` flag (used when setting up a signal handler with `sigaction`) instructs the kernel to automatically restart many interrupted system calls instead of causing them to fail with EINTR. 
  - Relieves the programmer from having to manually check for and restart the call in many cases.

---

## How It Works

- **Without SA_RESTART:**
  - A blocking system call like `read()` may return -1 and set `errno` to `EINTR` if a signal is caught. 
  - The application then needs to check for `EINTR` and loop to retry the call.
- **With SA_RESTART:**
  - The kernel will automatically restart certain system calls that were interrupted by a signal, so our program doesn't see the `EINTR` error.

**Note:** Not all system calls are restartable, but many of the common ones (like `read()`, `write()`, `accept()`, etc.) are when `SA_RESTART` is used.

## Blocking APIs

- One that stops or (blocks) the calling thread until the requested operation is complete.
  - Meaning that when we call a blocking function, one that reads data from a file or waits for an incoming network connection, the function won't return control to our program until the operation has finished.
  - This is because the OS or device driver understands that the event that the caller needs to wait upon has not yet occurred. Thus it must wait for it.
  - Once the event arises, the OS or driver wakes up the process. The process now continues to execute its code path.
- For example:
  - **read()**: When we call `read()` on a file descriptor, it waits until there’s data available to be read.
  - **accept()**: When a server calls `accept()` on a listening socket, it blocks until a new client connects.
  - More example includes `write()`, `select()`, `wait` and its variants.
- Blocking APIs are simple to use because 
  - They let us write code in a sequential manner without worrying about managing partial results or checking for operation readiness. 
- However, they can also lead to inefficiencies if a thread spends a long time waiting, since it can’t do any other work during that period.

## `SIGUSR1`

- `SIGUSR1` is one of two signals (the other being `SIGUSR2`) designated for user-defined purposes. 
- These signals provide a mechanism for interprocess communication, allowing processes to send and receive notifications for custom events.
- If a process receives `SIGUSR1` and hasn't defined a handler for it, the default action is to terminate the process.

### Common Uses of `SIGUSR1`:

- **nterprocess Communication**: 
  - Processes can send `SIGUSR1` to each other to signal the occurrence of specific events or to trigger actions.
  - For example, a child process might notify its parent process that it has completed a task by sending this signal.
- **Runtime Configuration**: 
  - Some applications use `SIGUSR1` to prompt the process to reload its configuration files without restarting.
  - This allows for dynamic updates to the application's behavior.

## Example Code for `SA_RESTART`

- We install a signal handler for `SIGUSR1` using `SA_RESTART`. 
- The main loop performs a blocking read on standard input.
- If `SIGUSR1` is delivered, the system call is automatically restarted rather than failing with `EINTR`.

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <strings.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <alloca.h>
#include <malloc.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/capability.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include "hello.h"

volatile sig_atomic_t got_signal = 0;

void sigusr1_handler(int sig)
{
    // set a flag or perform an async-signal-safe action
    got_signal = 1;
    write(STDOUT_FILENO, "SIGUSR1 received\n", 17); // async-signal-safe
}

int main()
{
    struct sigaction sa;
    sa.sa_handler = sigusr1_handler;
    sa.sa_flags = SA_RESTART; // automatically restart interrupted syscalls

    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);

    if (sigaction(SIGUSR1, &sa, NULL) == -1)
    {
        perror("sigaction");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    char buf[100];
    printf("Waiting for input (try sending SIGUSR1 in another terminal)...\n");

    // blocking read from STDIN. if interrupted by SIGUSR1, it is automatically restarted
    ssize_t n = read(STDIN_FILENO, buf, sizeof(buf));

    if (n < 0)
    {
        perror("read");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    buf[n] = '\0';
    printf("Read: %s\n", buf);
    if (got_signal)
    {
        printf("Signal flag was set during read.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

`1st Terminal`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Waiting for input (try sending SIGUSR1 in another terminal)...
SIGUSR1 received
^C
```

`2nd Terminal`

- `ps -e` because by default the `ps` command only shows processes attached to the current terminal.

```sh
chan@CMA:~$ ps -e
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
      1 ?        00:00:02 systemd
      2 ?        00:00:00 kthreadd
      ....
  39258 pts/3    00:00:00 bash
  39320 pts/4    00:00:00 bash
  39341 pts/1    00:00:00 final
  ....
chan@CMA:~$ kill -SIGUSR1 39341
```

- We can see the msg "SIGUSR1 received" and the `read()` call will continue waiting for input without failing.

## Summary

- Using `SA_RESTART` when installing signal handlers helps ensure that many blocking system calls are automatically restarted after a signal is handled, reducing the need for manual `EINTR` checks in our code.
