# Signal handling within the OS

- Signals are  not interrupts, nor faults or exception.
- Interruptions, traps, exceptions, faults are raised by the PIC/MMU/CPU hardware on a computer.
- Signals are purely a software feature.
- When a signal is sent to a process, the kernel updates the process's task structure in kernel memory.
  - Involves setting the `TIF_SIGPENDING` flag and marking the specific signal in the process's `sigpending` set.
  - These indicators inform the kernel that there are pending signals awaiting delivery to the process.
- Rather than delivering signals immediately upon their arrival, the kernel periodically checks for pending signals at specific points during process execution.
- If it finds one, the kernel then delivers the signal by invoking the appropriate signal handler within the process's user-space context.
- **Signal handling is thus considered to be more of a polling mechanism rather than an interrupt one.**
