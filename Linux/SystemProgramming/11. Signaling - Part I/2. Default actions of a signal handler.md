# The default action of the signal handler

- **Terminate**: Terminate the process
- **Term&Core**: 
  - Terminate the process and emit a core dump. 
  - (A core dump is essentially, a snapshot of the process's dynamic segments, the data and stack segments, at the time when the signal was delivered). 
  - This terminate and core dump action occurs when the kernel sends a fatal signal to a process.
  - We get a core dump when `SIGQUIT` is delivered to a process.
- **Ignore**: Ignore the signal.
- **Stop**: Process enters the stopped (frozen/suspended) state (represented by `T` in the output of `ps -l`).
- **Continue**: Continue execution of a previously stopped process.



- We can check all the signal, integer value, default action and comment of all Standard or Unix signals by running `man 7 signal`.
