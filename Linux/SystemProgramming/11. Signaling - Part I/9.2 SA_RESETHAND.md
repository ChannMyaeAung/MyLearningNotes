# The once only `SA_RESETHAND` flag

- On today's modern Linux systems, a signal handler remains as it is. It is not reset by default to the original handler.
- If we want this once-only behavior, use the `SA_RESETHAND` flag.
- For example, if we install a handler for `SIGINT `with `SA_RESETHAND`, the first Ctrl+C will invoke our handler, but subsequent `Ctrl+C` presses will cause the process to follow the default behavior for `SIGINT`.
