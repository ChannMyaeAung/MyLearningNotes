# To defer or not? Working with `SA_NODEFER`

- `SA_NODEFER` is a flag used when setting up a signal handler (with sigaction) that tells the kernel **not to automatically block the signal** that triggered the handler during its execution. 
- Normally, when a signal handler is invoked, the signal is temporarily added to the process’s signal mask to prevent it from reentering the same handler. 
  - Signals are peers, they have no priority associated with them.
  - For standard signals, if several instances of the same integer value are delivered, and that signal is currently masked (blocked), then only one instance is kept pending. There is no queuing.
- With `SA_NODEFER`, this behavior is disabled, so the same signal can interrupt the handler and be delivered again even if the previous instance hasn’t finished executing.

---

## Example Scenario #1

- Let's say we are writing an embedded real-time application, where signal delivery implies some real-world event has occurred and the application must respond to this immediately.
- In such cases, we would want to disable the auto-masking of signals (default behavior), thus allowing the signal handler to be reentered the moment it arrives.

---

## Example Scenario #2

- Let's say we will use `SA_NODEFER` signal flag.
- When the first instance of signal `n` arrives, our process jumps into the signal-handling code which will take 55ms let's say.
- The second signal will arrive just 10 ms into the signal handling code. But it is not maksed. It is not defered. (since we use `SA_NODEFER`).
- We will instead reenter the signal handler function immediately.
- Then 20 ms later, the third signal instance arrives. Again, we will reenter the signal handler function.

---

### Things to Consider

- The signal handler code itself must be written to be reentrant-safe (no global or static variable usage; only call async-signal safe functions within it), as it is being continually reentered.
- Stack usage: every time the signal handler is reentered, do realize that an additional call frame has been allocated (pushed) on to the process stack.

- `flags = SA_RESTART | SA_NODEFER;`

  - For example, if:

    - `SA_RESTART` is defined as `0x10000000`, and
    - `SA_NODEFER` is defined as `0x04000000`,

    then:

    ```c
    SA_RESTART | SA_NODEFER = 0x10000000 | 0x04000000 = 0x14000000.
    ```

  - So `flags` will hold `0x14000000` (in hexadecimal), which represents the combination of both flags.

**Without SA_NODEFER**:

- `SIGUSR1` signal from 2nd Terminal is caught, it emits a stream of numbers incremented on each signal instance.
- Though 12 instances of the `SIGUSR1` signal were delivered, the process was handling the first signal instance when the remaining 11 signals arrived. 
  - Hence, only one was kept pending and processed after the handler completed.

- We print the stack pointer value at every signal handler invocation. It's a **user-space** virtual address. The very same stack framer was reused for the signal handler function.

**With SA_NODEFER**:

- Unlike the previous run, 12 instances of the signal `SIGUSR1` are delivered one after the other. 
- Each instance preempts the previous one (setting up a new call frame on the process stack).
- After all signal instances have been handled, control is restored to the original context. We can see the stack unwind.
- We can see that the stack pointer values are progressively decreasing. 
  - Because on the `x86[_64]` CPU, a downward-growing stack is the way it works.

`2nd Terminal`

- Here, since our bombard shell script doesn't have execution permission, we give it using `chmod`.
- The `pgrep` figures out the PID of the program (`final`).
- We fire off 12 signals to the process.

```sh
chan@CMA:~$ cd C_Programming/test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./bombard_sig.sh $(pgrep final) 12

## Additional Notes

- While being powerful, the preceding program is very stack intensive.
- If we try to run with a large number like `./final 8000` , the program will result in a segmentation fault. (Runs out of stack space and crashes).
- The typical process stack resource limit is 8MB.
