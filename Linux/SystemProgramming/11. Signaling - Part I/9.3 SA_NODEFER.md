# To defer or not? Workign with `SA_NODEFER`

- `SA_NODEFER` is a flag used when setting up a signal handler (with sigaction) that tells the kernel **not to automatically block the signal** that triggered the handler during its execution. 
- Normally, when a signal handler is invoked, the signal is temporarily added to the process’s signal mask to prevent it from reentering the same handler. 
- With `SA_NODEFER`, this behavior is disabled, so the same signal can interrupt the handler and be delivered again even if the previous instance hasn’t finished executing.

### Example

- Let's say we are writing an embedded real-time application, where signal delivery implies some real-world event has occurred and the application must respond to this immediately.
- In such cases, we would want to disable the auto-masking of signals (default behavior), thus allowing the signal handler to be reentered the moment it arrives.
