# Different approaches to handling signals at high volume

| Method                                                       | Pros                                                         | Cons                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Use `sigfillset(3)` just prior to calling `sigaction(2)` to ensure that while the signal is being handled, all other signals are blocked. | Simple and straightforward approach.                         | Can lead to significant delays in handling and/or dropping signals |
| Setting the `SA_NODEFER` and handling all signals as they arrive | Simple and straightforward approach.                         | On load, heavy stack usage, danger of stack overflow.        |
| Use an alternate signal stack, set the `SA_NODEFER` and handle all signals as they arrive | Can specify alternate stack size as required                 | More work to setup. Must carefully test under load to determine max stack size to use. |
| Use real-time signals                                        | The OS queues pending signals automatically, low stack usage, signal prioritization possible. | System-wide limit on the maximum number that can be queued.  |
