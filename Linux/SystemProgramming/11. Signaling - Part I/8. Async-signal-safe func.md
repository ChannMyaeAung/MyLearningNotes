# Async-signal-safe functions

- Functions that can be safely called from within a signal handler without causing undefined behavior or deadlocks.
- When a signal handler is invoked, it may interrupt code that was executing, and if that code was in the middle of a non-reentrant operation (like using a global or static variable), calling a non-safe function can lead to data corruption or inconsistent state.

---

## Characteristics of Async-Signal-Safe Functions

- **Reentrancy:**
  - They are reentrant; they do not rely on shared, static, or global data that could be in an inconsistent state if interrupted.

- **No Blocking:**
  - They do not call functions that might block (e.g., I/O operations that wait indefinitely).

- **Minimal State Dependence:**
  - They use only local variables or those provided explicitly through parameters.

- **POSIX List:**
  - POSIX defines a list of functions that are async-signal-safe. Examples include:
    - `_exit()` – to exit immediately without cleanup.
    - `write()` – for writing to file descriptors.
    - `sigprocmask()` – for manipulating signal masks.
    - `kill()` – for sending signals.
  

In contrast, functions like `printf()`, `malloc()`, or `strtok()` are **not** async-signal-safe and should be avoided inside a signal handler.

**Note: We can check the POSIX manual page on signal-safety by running**:

```sh
$ man 7 signal-safety
```

## Example Code

- An example of a safe signal handler that uses only async-signal-safe funcs:
- **Note**: The safest approach is to set a flag (of type `volatile sig_atomic_t`) and then perform the actual processing in the main loop outside the signal handler.
  - The `volatile` keyword tells the compiler that a variable's value may change at any time without any action being taken by the code the compiler finds nearby.
  - This prevents the compiler from applying optimizations that assume the value does not change unexpectedly.
  - The type `sig_atomic_t` is the integer type of an object that can be accessed as an atomic entity even in the presence of asynchronous interrupts.
  - In the context of signals or multi-threaded programs, a `volatile sig_atomic_t` variable is used so that the compiler always reads its actual value from memory instead of caching it in a register. 
  - This ensures that when a signal handler modifies such a variable, the change is immediately visible to the rest of the program.
- Our signal handler function itself must be reentrant-safe.
- Do not access application global or static variables within it.
- It's important to realize that the usage of `sig_atomic_t` makes an (integer) variable only async-signal safe, not thread-safe.

// declares a global volatile flag variable of type sig_atomic_t
// Using volatile sig_atomic_t ensures that it is safely read and modified in a signal handler
volatile sig_atomic_t got_signal = 0;

// async-signal-safe handler using only safe functions.
void safe_handler(int signo)
{
    // write a short msg to STDOUT using write(), which is async-signal-safe.
    const char msg[] = "Signal received\n";
    
    // Write the message directly to STDOUT_FILENO using write(), which is async-signal-safe.
    // Use sizeof(msg) - 1 to avoid sending the terminating null byte.
    write(STDOUT_FILENO, msg, sizeof(msg) - 1);
    
    // must be volatile so that the main loop sees this change
    got_signal = 1; // set a flag indicating the signal was received.
}

int main()
{
    // Declare a sigaction structure to specify the signal handling behavior.
    struct sigaction sa;
    
    // Set the handler function for the signal to safe_handler.
    sa.sa_handler = safe_handler;
    
    // Set no extra flags (default behavior).
    sa.sa_flags = 0;
    
    // Initialize the set of signals to be blocked during the handler with an empty set.
    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);

    // Install the signal handler for SIGINT
    if (sigaction(SIGINT, &sa, NULL) == -1)
    {
        perror("sigaction");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf("Press Ctrl+C to trigger SIGINT...\n");

    // main loop that periodically checks the flag
    while (!got_signal)
    {
        sleep(1);
    }

    printf("Signal processing complete.\n");

    return 0;
}
```

- The signal handler `safe_handler` only calls `write()`, which is async-signal-safe.
- It sets a `volatile sig_atomic_t` flag to notify the main loop that a signal was received.
- The main loop then safely handles any additional processing outside the context of the signal handler.
- Without `volatile`, the compiler might optimize the loop by assuming that `got_signal` never changes, causing the loop to never exit even after the signal is received.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Press Ctrl+C to trigger SIGINT...
^CSignal received
Signal processing complete.
```

- When we press `Ctrl+C`, the signal handler prints "Signal received" (via the write call) and then sets `got_signal` to 1, causing the main loop to end and "Signal processing complete." to be printed.

## Why It Matters

Calling non-async-signal-safe functions in a signal handler might:

- Interfere with the normal execution flow if the signal interrupts a non-reentrant function.
- Lead to deadlocks, particularly if the function uses locks that are already held when the signal occurs.
