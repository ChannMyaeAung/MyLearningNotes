# Checking for a process's very existence

- Crucial to an application.
- The `kill(2)` system call helps us in this regard.
  - The 2nd param to `kill` is the signal to send. Using the value 0 (there is no signal numbered 0) validates the 1st param: the PID.
  - How? If the `kill(2)` returns failure, either the PID is invalid or we do not have permission to send the process or process group a signal.

## Pseudo-code

```c
static int app_func_A(int work, pid_t target){
    [...]
    if(kill(target, 0) < 0){
        <handle it>
        return -1;
        [... it's fine; do the work on 'target'...]
    }
}
```
