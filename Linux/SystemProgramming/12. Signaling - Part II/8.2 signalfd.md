# The `signalfd(2)` API

- With this, we can create a file descriptor, and associate it with a signal set.
- This API is another way to have a process or thread synchronously block upon signals.
  - It is not in and of itself a blocking call.
  - The blocking behavior comes into play only on the invocation of file-related API: `read()`, `select()`, or `poll()`.
  - Only then is the caller put into a sleep state.

```c
#include <sys/signalfd.h>
int signalfd(int fd, const sigset_t *mask, int flags);
```

- `fd`: an existing signal descriptor or the value -1. When -1 is passed, the system call creates a new signal file descriptor.
- `mask`: the set of signals that this signal descriptor will be associated with.
- `flags`: a mean to change the default behavior.
  - Possible values: `SFD_NONBLOCK`, `SFD_CLOEXEC`.
- `signalfd(2)` returns the newly created signal descriptor on success. (if the first param is -1).
- If not, then it should be an already existing signal descriptor; then the value is returned on success.
- On failure, -1 is returned and the `errno` variable reflects.
