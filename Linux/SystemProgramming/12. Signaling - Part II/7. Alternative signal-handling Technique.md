# Alternative signal-handling techniques

**Synchronously handling signals:** How to have the process or thread wait for (block upon) signals and handle them as they arrive.

## Difference between asynchronously and synchronously handling signals

- **Asynchronous Handling:** 
  - Means that we set up a signal handler (for example, using sigaction) and let the kernel interrupt our normal flow of execution to invoke the handler whenever the signal arrives. 
  - The signal can be delivered at any time, which makes it unpredictable and potentially reentrant if the handler itself is interrupted by another signal.

- **Synchronous Handling:** 
  - Involves explicitly waiting for a signal in our program using functions like `sigwait`, `sigtimedwait`, or `sigwaitinfo`. 
  - In this case, our program blocks until one of the **specified signals is delivered**, and then processes it in a controlled, predictable way. 
  - Avoids unexpected interruptions and the reentrancy issues that can occur with asynchronous handling.

## Synchronously waiting for signals

- Only a relatively small subset of APIs is considered async-signal-safe and is viable to use which raises significant hurdles in large programs.
- A number of useful mechanisms exist on the Linux OS to perform synchronous signal handling.

### Pause

- When a process calls this API, it blocks ,that is, it goes to sleep waiting for an event.
- The moment a signal arrives the pause is unblocked and execution continues.
- `pause()` is the one system call that always returns -1 and `errno` is set to the value `EINTR` Interrupted system call.
- For this reason, it is advised to code the `pause` as follows:

```c
(void)pause();
```

- The typecast to `void` is to inform tools such as the compiler and static analyzers that we don't really care about the return value from `pause`.
- The `pause` can be used to effectively and efficiently set up a useful wait forever or until I receive any signal semantic

```c
while(1){
    (void)pause();
}
```

- It's also inexpensive (hardly any CPU usage as the `pause(2)` has the caller immediately go to sleep) and get unblocked only when a signal arrives.
