# Synchronously blocking for signals via the `sigwait` APIs

- `sigwait(3)`
- `sigwaitinfo(2)`
- `sigtimedwait(2)`

All of these APIs allow a process (or thread) to block (wait) upon the delivery of  one or more signals.

---

## The sigwait library API

```c
#include <signal.h>
int sigwait(const sigset_t *set, int *sig);
```

- `sigwait(3)` allows a process or thread to block, wait until any signal in the signal-set `set` is pending delivery to it.
- The moment a signal arrives, the `sigwait` is unblocked
- The particular signal that arrived, its integer value, is placed in the `sig`.
- Under the hood, the `sigwait` removes the signal just delivered from the process pending mask.
- Thus `sigwait(3)` is advantageous to the `pause(2)`:
  - We can wait upon the delivery of particular signals to the process
  - When one of those signals is delivered, its value is known.
- The return value of `sigwait(3)` is 0 on success and a positive value on error. (it being a library API, `errno` remains unaffected).
- Internally the `sigwait(3)` is implemented via the `sigtimedwait(2)` API.

---

## Things to Consider

- If we don't block the signals we're planning to wait for before calling `sigwait`, a race condition can occur—there's a brief window between a signal being delivered to the process and the `sigwait` call initializing.

- Once running, it atomically unblocks the signals so that they can be delivered to the waiting thread.

- Now, consider if a signal from that set is being caught in two ways at the same time: one via a signal handler (installed with sigaction or signal) and the other via `sigwait`. 

  - The POSIX standard leaves it up to the system to decide which handler gets to process the signal. 
  - On Linux, for instance, the kernel favors `sigwait`: if a signal in the set becomes pending, the `sigwait` call "consumes" it—removing it from the pending list—so that it never reaches the regular signal handler.

  - If a process issues the `sigwait` API, the process blocks on signals.
  - If a signal does become pending (it has just been delivered) on the process, then the `sigwait` API consumes the signal.
  - It is no longer pending delivery on the process and thus cannot be caught via signal handlers set up via the `sigaction(2)` or `signal(3)` APIs.

### Output #1

`1st Terminal`

- We have first blocked all signals via the `sigprocmask(2)`.
- We invoke our `show_blocked_signals()` in `hello.c` function to display all currently blocked signals in the process signal mask.
- All are blocked, except 9, 19, 32, and 33 because once running, the `sigwait(3)` will automatically unblock the signals allowing them to be delivered upon the caller.

`2nd Terminal`

- We run the shell file in another terminal. 
- It sends every signal from 1 to 64 except for `SIGKILL(9)`, `SIGSTOP(19)`, 32 and 33 via `kill(1)` (two RT signals reserved for use by the pthreads framework).
- After that we can `pkill(1)` to kill off our `final` process.

chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ pkill -SIGKILL final
```

- Looking at the `1st Terminal` , all delivered signals were processed via the `sigwait`, including the `SIGFPE(#8)` and the `SIGSEGV(#11)`.
- This is as they were synchronously sent by another process and not by the kernel.



### Output #2

- Now we try running with option `1`:

```

## Additional Notes

- If the signal is blocked by the process before invoking the `sigwait` then if the signal is delivered artificially via `kill(2)` (or variants), the `sigwait` will get unblocked upon delivery of the signal and the application developer can handle the signal.
- If the fatal signal is delivered via the OS due to a bug, then whether or not the process blocks it, the default action takes place, abruptly killing the process.
- It's better to trap fatal signals like the preceding via the usual asynchronous `sigaction(2)` style and not via the `sigwait`.
