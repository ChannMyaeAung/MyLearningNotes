# The errno race

- Occurs when multiple threads or processes interact with the `errno` variable in an unsafe manner, leading to incorrect or unpredictable behavior. 
- Since `errno` is typically a global or thread-local variable used to store error codes from system calls and library functions, concurrent modifications can result in race conditions where a thread accesses `errno` after it has been overwritten by another thread.

---

## Example Scenario

- `foo()` issues a system call, `open(2)`.
- The system call fails return -1.
  - `errno` gets set to the positive integer 13 reflecting the error permission denied (errno macro `EACCES`).
- The signal `SIGUSR1` is delivered at this instant to the process.
  - Control is switched to the signal handler routine, `handle_sigusr`.
    - The code here issues another system call, say, `stat(2)`.
    - The `stat(2)` system call fails returning -1.
      - `errno` now gets set to the positive integer 9 reflecting the error bad file number (`errno` macro `EBADF`).
    - The signal handler returns.
- The system call's error-handling code calls `perror(3)` to emit the English error message.
- As we can see, the value of `errno` gets overwritten from 13 to 9 because of the sequence of events.

## From the key points in the Intro and Example Scenario, we can summarize the key causes of `errno` race to the followings:

- **Shared errno across threads:** In non-thread-safe environments, `errno` may be a global variable instead of a thread-local one, making it vulnerable to being overwritten by concurrent function calls.

- **Multiple system calls in succession:** If a function that checks `errno` calls another function before reading `errno`, the new function may reset `errno`, leading to misleading error handling.

- **Improper use of errno in signal handlers:** If a signal handler modifies `errno` and then returns, the main program might read an incorrect value.

---

## Fixing the errno race

- Whenever we have a signal handler with code within it that could possibly cause the `errno` value to change, save `errno` upon function entry and restore it just before returning from the handler.

```c
#include <errno.h>

static void handle_sigusr(int signum){
    int myerrno = errno;
    <... do the handling ... >
    <... syscalls, etc ... >
    errno = myerrno;
}
```

- **Use `errno` immediately after a failing system call** to prevent it from being modified by subsequent calls.
- **Use `perror()` or `strerror(errno)` immediately** after a failing function to log errors before `errno` changes.
- **Ensure thread safety with POSIX Thread Local Storage (TLS):** Modern systems provide `errno` as a thread-local variable (`__thread errno` or `__declspec(thread) errno` in Windows) to avoid interference.
- **Avoid modifying errno manually** in multi-threaded programs unless absolutely necessary.
- **Use thread-safe functions:** Instead of `strerror()`, use `strerror_r()` in multi-threaded applications.
