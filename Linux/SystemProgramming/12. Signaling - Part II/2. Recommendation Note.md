# Recommendation

- Handling the segfault, the `SIGSEGV`, can be very beneficial to figuring out the cause of a crash.
- However, once this signal is generated upon a process, the process is considered to be in an undefined, unstable state.
- Keeping the signal handling code to a minimum is recommended.
