# The `sigwaitinfo` and the `sigtimedwait` system calls

- The `sigwaitinfo(2)` is similar to `sigwait`.
  - Provided with a set of signals to watch out for, the function puts the caller to sleep until any one of those signals are pending.

```c
#include <signal.h>
int sigwaitinfo(const sigset_t *set, siginfo_t *info);
int sigtimedwait(const sigset_t *set, siginfo_t *info, const struct timespec *timeout);
```

- `sigtimedwait`: Similar to `sigwaitinfo(2)`, except the additional param `timeout`.
  - The function will block the caller either until one of the signals in set is pending, or the timeout expires. (whichever occurs first).
  - The `timeout` is specified via a simple `timespec` struct, which allows one to provide the time in seconds and nanoseconds.

```c
struct timespec{
    long tv_sec;
    long tv_nsec;
}
```

- If the struct is memset to zero, the `sigtimedwait(2)` returns immediately, either with information returned about a signal that was pending, or an error value.
- Both the `sigwaitinfo(2)` and the `sigtimedwait(2)` APIs return the actual signal number on success and -1 on failure, with `errno` set appropriately.
- Neither `sigwait`, `sigwaitinfo`, or `sigtimedwait` APIs can wait for synchronously generated signals from kernal like `SIGFPE` and `SIGSEGV`. 
  - These can only be caught in the normal asynchronous fashion via `signal(2)` or `sigaction(2)`. 
  - For such cases, the `sigaction(2)` system call would be a better choice.
