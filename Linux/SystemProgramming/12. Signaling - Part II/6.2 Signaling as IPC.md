# Signaling as IPC

- Fundamental side effect of the virtual memory architecture: 
  - A process can only access memory within its own **virtual address space (VAS)** and that too only the valid mapped memory.
- A process cannot read from or write into the VAS of any other process.
- But they can communicate with other processes via IPC mechanisms. The Linux OS has several. We make use of one of them: **signaling**.

## Crude IPC

We can devise a simple IPC scheme via signaling as follows:

- Process A and Process  B are performing their work. (run in parallel).
- A reaches a milestone. Informs B of this by sending it `SIGUSR1` via the `kill(2)`.
- Having trapped the signal, B enters its signal handler and acknowledges the msg by sending process A `SIGUSR2` via the `kill(2)`.
- Having trapped the signal, A enters its signal handler, understands that the ack has been received from B, and life continues.



Above we have not been able to transmit or receive any data. Just the fact that we can communicate via signals. We can think of this as **a crude IPC mechanism**.

## Better IPC - sending a data item

- It is possible to send a piece of data via signals.
- Within `siginfo_t` struct, the 1st three members are simple integers, the 4th member is a union of structures.
- Within the union of structs, we going to look at the one that deals with real-time signals

```c
// POSIX.1b signals
struct{
    _pid_t si_pid; // Sending process ID.
    _uid_t si_uid; // real user ID of sending process
    _sigval_t si_sigval; // signal value
}
```



```c
union _sigval
{
    int _sival_int;
    void *_sival_ptr;
};

typedef union _sigval _sigval_t;
```

- The `sigval_t` union has two members—an integer (`sival_int`) and a pointer (`sival_ptr`). 
- Because a union can only hold one member’s value at a time, we must choose one way to piggy-back our data onto a real-time signal.

- Using the pointer (`sival_ptr`) might seem appealing, but pointers are just virtual addresses. 
- An address in one process’s memory space has no meaning in another process’s address space. In other words, if we send a pointer, the receiver will likely see an invalid or meaningless address.
- In contrast, using the integer (`sival_int`) is generally more reliable for inter-process communication via signals. 
- An integer is a plain value that both the sender and receiver can understand regardless of their separate memory mappings. 
- Furthermore, C programmers can pack extra information into an integer (for example, by using it as a bitmask) if needed.

In summary, because of the nature of virtual memory, it’s usually better to use `sival_int` to communicate data between processes via real-time signals.



#### `sigqueue`

- Additionally, the C library provides a helper routine to quite easily send a signal with data embedded within, the `sigqueue(3)` API.

```c
#include <signal.h>
int sigqueue(pid_t pid, int sig, const union sigval value);
```

- `pid`: The process to send the signal `sig`.
- The 3rd param is the union discussed.
