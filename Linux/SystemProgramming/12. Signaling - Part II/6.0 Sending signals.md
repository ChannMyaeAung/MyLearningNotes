# Sending signals

- Signal-sending could be used as an **interprocess communication (IPC)** mechanism.
- We can send a signal to another process via the `kill(2)` system call.
- The `kill()` API can deliver any signal to a process given its PID.

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <signal.h>

int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);
```

- The user command `kill` is a wrapper over the `kill(2)` system call.

- Every process will be a member of a process group (each pgrp will have its own unique ID, equal to the PID of the first member, called the **process group leader**.)
- `ps j` to look up process group details.

```sh
chan@CMA:~$ ps j
   PPID     PID    PGID     SID TTY        TPGID STAT   UID   TIME COMMAND
   1580    1992    1992    1992 tty2        1992 Ssl+  1000   0:00 /usr/libexec/
   1992    1996    1992    1992 tty2        1992 Sl+   1000   0:00 /usr/libexec/
   3759    3841    3841    3841 pts/0       3841 Ss+   1000   0:00 bash
   3759    8141    8141    8141 pts/1       8141 Ss+   1000   0:00 bash
   3759    8154    8154    8154 pts/2      12351 Ss    1000   0:00 bash
   3759    8177    8177    8177 pts/3       8177 Ss+   1000   0:00 bash
   8154   12351   12351    8154 pts/2      12351 R+    1000   0:00 ps j

```

## Example scenario

- Typing Ctrl + C while running a chain of processes via pipes (e.g `ps aux | tail | sort -k6n`) , causes the signal `SIGINT` to be generated via the kernel's tty layer to **all the processes belonging in the foreground process group**. (all 3 will receive the signal).

- On Linux, `kill (-1, sig)` does not send `sig` to the calling process itself.

## Permission to kill

- The required permission: the sending process must either:
  - Have root privileges. `CAP_KILL` capability set: Bypass permission checks for sending signals.
  - Own the target process, which implies that the sender's EUID (effective UID) or RUID (real UID) and the target's EUID or RUID should match.
