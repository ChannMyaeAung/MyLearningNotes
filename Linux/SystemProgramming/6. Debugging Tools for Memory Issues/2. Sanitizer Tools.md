# Sanitizer tools

- Sanitizer tools are runtime debugging utilities that help detect and diagnose memory-related errors in our programs. 
- They work by instrumenting our code—typically via compiler flags—to add runtime checks that catch issues such as buffer overflows, memory leaks, use-after-free errors, and data races. 



## Examples

- **AddressSanitizer (ASan):**
  - Detects memory corruption bugs like out-of-bounds accesses and use-after-free errors.
- **MemorySanitizer (MSan):**
  - Identifies uses of uninitialized memory, ensuring that all memory is properly initialized before use.
- **ThreadSanitizer (TSan):**
  - Helps catch data races and synchronization issues in multithreaded programs.
- **UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan):**
  - Reports various types of undefined behavior, which can lead to unpredictable program behavior.

Using these tools usually involves compiling our code with specific flags (for example, using `-fsanitize=address` with GCC or Clang) and then running the instrumented executable. This approach makes it much easier to locate and fix subtle bugs that might not be obvious during normal testing.

These sanitizers are invaluable for ensuring program reliability and security, especially in a complex, low-level system programming environment like Linux.

## AddressSanitizer pros and cons - a quick summary

ASan pros:

- Catches common memory bugs (UB) on both statically (compile-time) and dynamically allocated memory regions
  - Out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access (read/write underflow/overflow bugs)
  - Use-after-free (UAF) bugs
  - Use-after-return (UAR) bugs
  - Double free
  - Leakage
- Performance is far superior to other tools (such as Valgrind), the worst case performance drop seems to be a factor 2x.
- No modification to source code required
- Fully supports multithreaded applications



ASan cons:

- ASan cannot detect some types of bugs:
  - UMR (as mentioned earlier, with some caveats, MSan can)
  - Does not detect all UAF bugs
  - IOF (integer Underflow/Overflow) bugs
- Using a certain tool at a time; cannot always combine multiple sanitizer tools. 
  - This implies that often, separate test cases must be written for ASan, TSan, LSan.
- Compiler:
  - Often, the program is required to be recompiled with the LLVM frontend Clang and appropriate compiler flags.
  - In order to see the call stack with line number information, a recompile/build with the `-g` flag is required.
