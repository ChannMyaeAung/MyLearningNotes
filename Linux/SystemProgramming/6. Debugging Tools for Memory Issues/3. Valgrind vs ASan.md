### Sanitizer Tools

- **Performance:**
  - Tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan), ThreadSanitizer (TSan), and others are integrated at compile time. 
  - They impose a relatively low runtime overhead, which makes them suitable for regular development and even use in continuous integration systems.
- **Detection Scope:**
  - Sanitizers are very effective at detecting many common memory bugs—such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and data races—and they often report issues immediately as the faulty code is executed.
- **Ease of Integration:**
  - They require compiling our code with specific flags (e.g., `-fsanitize=address`) and tend to integrate smoothly into modern build and testing workflows.

### Valgrind

- **Thoroughness:**
  - Valgrind (especially its Memcheck tool) is known for its comprehensive detection capabilities. 
  - It can catch a wide range of memory errors, including leaks, uninitialized memory reads, and other subtle issues.
- **Overhead:**
  - However, Valgrind works by simulating the execution of our code, which generally makes it much slower than sanitizers. 
  - This high overhead can make it less practical for large-scale or performance-sensitive testing.
- **Usage Context:**
  - Valgrind is often used for deep-dive debugging sessions or in situations where the performance cost is acceptable in exchange for more exhaustive analysis.

### Summary

- **For Daily Development and CI:**
  - Sanitizer tools are usually preferred because they offer rapid feedback with minimal performance impact.
- **For In-Depth Analysis:**
  - Valgrind might be chosen when a more thorough investigation is needed and execution speed is not a primary concern.

In many workflows, developers use both: sanitizers for fast, early detection and Valgrind for more comprehensive, detailed analysis.
