# CLI, not GUI

- The Unix OS, and all its applications, utilities and tools, were always built to be used from a **command-line-interface (CLI)**, typically, the shell.
- From the 1980s onward, the need for a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** became apparent.
- Whenever appropriate, design your tools to work in the CLI environment, adapting it into a GUI at a later point is then straightforward.
