# Overrun

- A situation where a timer expires multiple times before the previous expiration notification has been handled. 
- This can happen with periodic timers if the signal handler or thread processing the timer event doesn't complete before the next timer expiration occurs. 
- To check how many extra expirations were missed (i.e., the number of overruns), we can use `timer_getoverrun()`, which returns a count indicating these additional expirations. 
- This count helps ensure that our application can account for every timer event, even if some signals or notifications are delayed.
