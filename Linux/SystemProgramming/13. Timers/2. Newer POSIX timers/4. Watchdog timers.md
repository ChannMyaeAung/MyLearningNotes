# A Quick note on watchdog timers

- A safety mechanism used to detect and recover from malfunctions. 
- It works by expecting periodic "kicks" or resets from the system; if these are missed, the timer expires and triggers a corrective action (typically a system reset) to recover from a potential fault. 
- This ensures that if the system hangs or becomes unresponsive, it can be automatically restarted to maintain reliability.
