# Creating and using a POSIX (interval) timer

- `timer_create()` system call to create a timer for the calling process.
- Upon `fork(2)`, all timers get auto-disarmed. Timers are not going to continue towards expirary in the child process.
- Upon `execve(2)`, all timers are deleted and will thus not be visible in the successor process.

```c
#include <signal.h>
#include <time.h>

int timer_create(clockid_t clockid, struct sigevent *sevp, timer_t *timerid);
```

- We have to link with the **real time (rt)** library to amke use of this API. (-lrt).
- `timer_create()` takes three parameters:
  - **`clockid`:** Specifies the clock to use (for example, CLOCK_REALTIME or CLOCK_MONOTONIC) to measure time for the timer.
  - **`sevp`:** A pointer to a sigevent structure that determines how the process is notified when the timer expires (e.g., by sending a signal or starting a new thread).
  - **`timerid`:** A pointer to a `timer_t` variable where the system stores the newly created timerâ€™s identifier, which we then use in later timer operations. 

- ```c
  #include <signal.h>
  union sigval { /* Data passed with notification */
  	int sival_int; /* Integer value */
  	void *sival_ptr; /* Pointer value */
  };
  struct sigevent {
  	int sigev_notify; /* Notification method */
  	int sigev_signo; /* Notification signal */
  	union sigval sigev_value; /* Data passed with notification */
  	void (*sigev_notify_function) (union sigval); /* Function used for thread notification (SIGEV_THREAD) */
  	void *sigev_notify_attributes; /* Attributes for notification
  thread(SIGEV_THREAD) */
  	pid_t sigev_notify_thread_id; /* ID of thread to signal (SIGEV_THREAD_ID) */
  };
  ```

- On success, `timer_create()` returns a timer ID that we can use in subsequent calls (like `timer_settime()`, `timer_gettime()`, and `timer_delete()`) to manage the timer.
