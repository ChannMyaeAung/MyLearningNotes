# The newer POSIX (interval) timers mechanism

Newer POSIX timer APIs—such as those created via `timer_create()` and managed with `timer_settime()`—offer a number of improvements over older mechanisms like  `alarm()` and `setitimer()`. 

- **Multiple Independent Timers:**
  - Unlike the older interfaces, which are typically process-wide (meaning we can only have one timer per type), the newer APIs let us create many timers within a process. 
  - Essential for complex, multi-threaded applications where different components may need their own timers.
- A generic `sigevent(7)` mechanism (a way to handle async events such as timer expiry, AIO request completion, delivery of a message) to handle timer expiry. We are now not forced to tie timer expiry to the signaling mechanism.
- **Absolute and Relative Timeouts:**
  - The newer APIs support both relative timeouts (a delay from “now”) and absolute timeouts (a specific clock time). 
  - This flexibility is important if one need a timer that “fires” at a precise wall-clock time and adapts if the system time changes.
- **Improved Clock Options:**
  - They allow us to choose among several clocks (like CLOCK_MONOTONIC or CLOCK_REALTIME). For instance, CLOCK_MONOTONIC isn’t affected by system time adjustments, which helps ensure that the timer’s behavior remains predictable.
- **Better Integration with Asynchronous I/O:**
  - Because they are designed with real-time and multi-threaded environments in mind, these timers can be integrated with event loops and I/O multiplexing (e.g., with `timerfd` on Linux). This makes it easier to compose timers with other asynchronous events.
- **Cleaner Notification Methods:**
  - While the new APIs can still deliver notifications via signals (or even thread-based callbacks with `SIGEV_THREAD`), they offer more options and flexibility compared to the older alarm-based mechanisms, which can be hard to manage especially in complex applications.
