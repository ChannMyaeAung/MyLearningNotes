# Typical application workflow

For setting up and using modern POSIX timers:

- **Configure Signal Handling:**
  - Before creating timers, set up the signal handlers (e.g., using `sigaction`) to catch timer-related signals.
- **Create and Initialize Timers:**
  - Use `timer_create` to create one or more timers. 
  - At this stage, choose the appropriate clock source and decide whether the timer should notify via a signal or by launching a new thread.
- **Start or Stop the Timer:**
  - Arm the timer (start the countdown) with `timer_settime`, or disarm it if we need to cancel the countdown.
- **Monitor Timer Status:**
  - Use `timer_gettime` to check the remaining time until expiration, as well as any interval settings that have been configured.
- **Check for Overruns:**
  - If the timer expires repeatedly, use `timer_getoverrun` to determine if any timer expirations were missed.
- **Clean Up:**
  - When the timer is no longer needed, call `timer_delete` to both disarm and remove the timer.

This sequence ensures that timers are correctly configured, activated, and monitored, providing a reliable method for managing timed events in our application.
