# Querying the timer

- Involves retrieving its current settings and status, which is typically done using the `timer_gettime()` function. 
- This function provides insight into how much time is left before the timer expires and, if itâ€™s set to repeat, what the interval is for subsequent expirations.
- Querying the timer is useful for monitoring its state or debugging timer-related functionality in our application.

```c
#include <time.h>
int timer_gettime(time_t timerid, struct itimerspec *curr_value);
```

- **`timerid`:**
  - The identifier of the timer we want to query. 
  - This ID was obtained when we created the timer with `timer_create()`.
- **`curr_value`:**
  A pointer to a struct `itimerspec` structure. Once the call is made, this structure is filled with:
  - **it_value:**
    - The amount of time remaining until the timer's next expiration. If this is zero, the timer is disarmed.
  - **it_interval:**
    - The interval for periodic timers. If the timer is non-periodic, this value will be zero.
