# Old interfaces

- `alarm(2)` system call
- The interval timer `[get | set] itimer(2)` system call APIs

---

## The good ol' alarm clock

- allows a process to setup a simple timeout mechanism.

```c
#include <unistd.h>
unsigned int alarm(unsigned int seconds);
```

- `alarm(3)`: Three seconds after the alarm system call is issued, the kernel will send the signal `SIGALRM` to the process which default action is to terminate the process.
  - `SIGALRM` (signal #14 on x86).
- Returns an unsigned integer (unusual for a system call). (-1  == failure). Returns the number of seconds to any previous programmed timeout or zero if none was pending.

### Code Example # 1

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <strings.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <alloca.h>
#include <malloc.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/capability.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <time.h>
#include "hello.h"

static void sighandler(int signum)
{
    const char *str = "*** Timeout! [SIGALRM received] ***\n";
    if (signum != SIGALRM)
    {
        return;
    }
    if (write(STDOUT_FILENO, str, strlen(str)) < 0)
    {
        perror("write str failed!");
    }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int n = 0;
    struct sigaction sa;

    if (argc != 2)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s seconds-to-timeout(>0)\n", argv[0]);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    n = atoi(argv[1]);
    if (n <= 0)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Invalid timeout value: %d\n", n);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // init sigaction to defaults via the memset
    // setup sig_handler as the signal handler func
    // trap just the SIGALRM signal
    memset(&sa, 0, sizeof(sa));
    sa.sa_handler = sighandler;
    if (sigaction(SIGALRM, &sa, 0) < 0)
    {
        perror("sigaction failed!");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    alarm(n);
    printf("A timeout for %ds has been armed...\n", n);
    pause();
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Usage: ./final seconds-to-timeout(>0)
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final 3
A timeout for 3s has been armed...
*** Timeout! [SIGALRM received] ***

```

---

### Code Example #2

- Now we enhance the previous program to have the timeout continually repeat.
- All the codes are the same. Just added the following to the main:

```c
alarm(n);
    printf("A timeout for %ds has been armed...\n", n);

    // manually reinvoke the alarm every "n" seconds
    while (1)
    {
        pause();
        alarm(n);
        printf("A timeout for %ds has been rearmed...\n", n);
    }
    return 0;
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final
Usage: ./final seconds-to-timeout(>0)
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/test$ ./final 2
A timeout for 2s has been armed...
*** Timeout! [SIGALRM received] ***
A timeout for 2s has been rearmed...
*** Timeout! [SIGALRM received] ***
A timeout for 2s has been rearmed...
*** Timeout! [SIGALRM received] ***
A timeout for 2s has been rearmed...
*** Timeout! [SIGALRM received] ***
A timeout for 2s has been rearmed...
^C
```

## Downsides of `alarm()` API

- A minimum of one second, which is a very long time on a modern processor.
- Running more than a single timeout in parallel is not possible.
  - Since `alarm()` operates at the process level, it does not work well in multi-threaded programs where different threads may need independent timers.
- Not possible to query or modify the timeout value at a later point, attempting to do so will cancel it.
- Mixing the following APIs can result in problems/conflicts
  - `alarm(2)` and `setitimer(2)`
  - `alarm(2)` and `sleep(3)`
- Is possible that the timeout occurs later than expected.
- **Obsolete Compared to Modern APIs:** More flexible alternatives like `setitimer()`, `timer_create()`, and `timerfd_create()` provide better precision and multiple independent timers.
