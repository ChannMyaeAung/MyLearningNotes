# Brief Intro Notes on Timers

- Timers in system programming are mechanisms that allow processes or the kernel to track time and schedule actions after a specified interval. 
- Crucial for scheduling, performance monitoring, and implementing timeouts.

**Key types of general-purpose timers in system programming include:**

- **Hardware Timers:** Low-level timers managed by the CPU and system clock, used for scheduling and real-time applications.
- **Kernel Timers:** Used by the OS to schedule tasks, measure execution time, and manage timeouts.
- **User-space Timers:** Provided via system calls like `setitimer`, `timer_create`, and `alarm`, allowing applications to execute functions after a specified delay or at periodic intervals.
- **POSIX Timers:** Allow for fine-grained time control, supporting multiple independent timers per process.
