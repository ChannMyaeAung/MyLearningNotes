# I/O performance recommendations

- The underlying storage (disk) hardware is much slower than RAM.
- Devising strategies to minimise going to the disk and working more from memory will always help.
- In fact, both the library layer and the OS will perform a lot of work to ensure this.
- If feasible, we should use large buffers (to hold the data read or to be written) when performing I/O operations upon a file.
- A good rule of thumb is to use the same size for the local buffer as the I/O block size of the filesystem upon which the file resides.
- To query it, issue the `stat(1)` command upon the file in which we want to perform I/O.
