# Direct I/O (DIO)

- **Direct I/O** bypasses the operating system’s page (buffer) cache so that data is transferred directly between user space and the disk. 

  - This can help reduce overhead and avoid double buffering, which is beneficial for applications that manage their own caching or need predictable latency. 

  - However, Direct I/O has some challenges:

    - **Alignment Restrictions:**
      - Data buffers and file offsets usually need to be aligned to the disk’s block size.

    - **No Caching Benefits:**
      - Since the OS cache is bypassed, we lose benefits like cache hits for frequently accessed data.

    - **Complexity:**
      - Applications must handle potential performance trade-offs and manage their own caching strategy.

## Use case scenario

- Database systems or applications that manage their own caching.
- Situations where caching is not beneficial or may even hurt performance due to large, sequential reads/writes.
