# The kernel page cache

- Within the kernel, every single file I/O operation is cached within a global kernel cache called the **page cache**.

- When a process writes data to a file, the data buffer is not immediately flushed to the underlying block device (disk or flash storage), it is cached in the page cahce.

- Similarly, when a process reads data from the underlying block device, the data buffer is not instantly copied to the user space process memory buffer.

  - It is stored within the page cache first.
  - and the process will actually retrieve it from there.

- The kernel's page cache is useful because,

  - By exploting the key property of a cache, "the speed discrepancy between the cached memory region (RAM) and the region it is caching (the block device)", we gain tremendous performance.
  - The page cache is in RAM, thus keeping the contents of all file I/O cached pretty much guarantees hits on the cache when applications perform reads on file data. (similar concepts apply to writing).
