# Files on Linux

#### /usr

> /user directory tree is likely the largest one on a Linux system. It contains all the programs and support files  used by regular users.




#### /usr/bin

> /usr/bin contains the binaries or  executable programs installed by your Linux distribution.



#### /usr/sbin

> /usr/sbin contains system binaries that should only be executed by the root user. (E.g. mount, deleteuser)



#### /etc - ET CETERA or Editable Text Config

> the `/etc` directory is a crucial component, acting as the central location for system-wide configuration files. Its name originates from "et cetera,"  meaning "and the rest" in Latin.
>
> Here's a breakdown of the `/etc` directory's role:
>
> - **Configuration Files:** It stores essential configuration files that govern various system aspects like network settings (e.g., `/etc/network/interfaces`), user accounts (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), printers (e.g., `/etc/cups/printers.conf`), and more. Modifying these files allows you to customize system behavior.
> - **Historical Context:** Initially, `/etc` served as a generic repository for various files that didn't fit neatly into other standard directories. Over time, its purpose evolved into specifically storing configuration files.
> - **Importance:** The configuration files within `/etc` are vital for the system's proper operation. Editing them requires caution, as mistakes can lead to malfunctions. It's generally recommended for experienced users to modify these files.
