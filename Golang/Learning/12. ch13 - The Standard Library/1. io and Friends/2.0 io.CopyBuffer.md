# `io.CopyBuffer`

```go
func CopyBuffer(dst Writer, src Reader, buf []byte) (written int64, err error)
```

- **Purpose**: Same as `io.Copy`, but we supply the buffer. If we want to reuse a scratch buffer (for memory constraints), we can pass it in.
- **Usage**: Usually only needed if we want to control the buffer size or reuse one buffer across many copies.

## Code Example (Copy with a custom buffer)

- Here the size of our buffer only limits how much is read per iteration, not the total bytes copied.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	f, err := os.Open("test.txt")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	defer f.Close()
	buf := make([]byte, 8)
	n, err := io.CopyBuffer(os.Stdout, f, buf)
	if err != nil && err != io.EOF {
		fmt.Println("CopyBuffer error: ", err)

	}
	fmt.Printf("\nCopied %d bytes using a custom buffer.\n", n)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./main
Hello, Gophers!
Copied 15 bytes using a custom buffer.
```

- First read pulls 8 bytes (“Hello, G”), writes them out.
- Second read pulls the remaining 7 bytes (“ophers!\n”), writes them out.
- EOF stops the loop, and `n` is `8 + 7 == 15`.

That’s why we see 15 bytes copied even though our buffer slice is only 8 bytes long.
