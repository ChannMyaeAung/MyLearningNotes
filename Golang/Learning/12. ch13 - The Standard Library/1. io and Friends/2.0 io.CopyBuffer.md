# `io.CopyBuffer`

```go
func CopyBuffer(dst Writer, src Reader, buf []byte) (written int64, err error)
```

- **Purpose**: Same as `io.Copy`, but we supply the buffer. If we want to reuse a scratch buffer (for memory constraints), we can pass it in.
- **Usage**: Usually only needed if we want to control the buffer size or reuse one buffer across many copies.

## Code Example (Copy with a custom buffer)
