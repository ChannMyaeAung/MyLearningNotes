# encoding/json

- REST APIs have enshrined JSON as the standard way to communicate between services.
- Go's standard library includes support for converting Go data types to and from JSON.
- **marshaling**: means converting from a Go data type to an encoding.
- **unmarshaling**: means converting to a Go data type.
- When unmarshaling from JSON into a struct field with no json tag, the name match is case-insensitive. 
- When marshaling a struct field with no json tag back to JSON, the JSON field will always have an uppercase first letter, because the field is exported.
- The `encoding/json` package inspects `json:"fieldName,omitempty"` to decide how to (un)marshal.
- The first part before a comma is the desired JSON key; `omitempty` says “omit if zero‐valued.”
- We can also write `json:"fieldName,string"` to instruct the JSON encoder to emit numeric types as strings (and decode accordingly).
