# Using Maps as Sets

- A set is a data type that ensures there is at most one of a value, but doesn't guarantee that the values are in any particular order.
- Checking to see if an element is in a set is fast, no matter how many elements are in the set.
- Go doesn't include a set, but we can use a map to simulate some of its features.

---

## Using a map as a set

- A map's keys are always unique.
- We write 11 values into `intSet`, but the length of `intSet` is 8, 
  - because we cannot have duplicate keys in a map.
- By writing into the map with the value `true`, we've effectively filtered out duplicates.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	intSet := map[int]bool{}
	vals := []int{5, 10, 2, 5, 8, 7, 3, 9, 1, 2, 10}
    
    // associate each int with the boolean value true
    // if v was already seen, we're just reassigning the same map entry, not adding a new one.
	for _, v := range vals {
		intSet[v] = true
	}

	fmt.Printf("len(vals): %d, len(intSet): %d\n", len(vals), len(intSet))
	fmt.Println("intSet: ", intSet)
	fmt.Println("intSet[5]: ", intSet[5])
	fmt.Println("intSet[500]: ", intSet[500])
	if intSet[100] {
		fmt.Println("100 is in the set")
	}
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
len(vals): 11, len(intSet): 8
intSet:  map[1:true 2:true 3:true 5:true 7:true 8:true 9:true 10:true]
intSet[5]:  true
intSet[500]:  false
```

- `len(vals)` is larger because it counts every occurrence.
- `len(intSet)` counts only unique keys.

## Using struct for the value

- Some prefer to use `struct{}` for the value when a map is being used to implement a set.
- **Advantage:** an empty struct uses zero bytes, while a boolean uses one byte.
- **Disadvantage:** using a `struct{}` makes the code clumsier with less obvious assignment and we need to use the comma ok idiom to check if a value is in the set.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	intSet := map[int]struct{}{}
	vals := []int{5, 10, 2, 5, 8, 7, 3, 9, 1, 2, 10}

	for _, v := range vals {
		intSet[v] = struct{}{}
	}

	fmt.Println("intSet: ", intSet)
	fmt.Printf("Type of intSet: %T\n", intSet)
	if _, ok := intSet[5]; ok {
		fmt.Println("5 is in the set")
	}
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
intSet:  map[1:{} 2:{} 3:{} 5:{} 7:{} 8:{} 9:{} 10:{}]
Type of intSet: map[int]struct {}
5 is in the set
```
