# Emptying a Slice

- `clear` function that takes in a slice and sets all of the slice's elements to their zero value
- The length of the slice remains unchanged.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	s := []string{"first", "second", "third"}
	fmt.Printf("s: %v, len(s): %d, cap(s): %d\n", s, len(s), cap(s))
	clear(s)
	fmt.Printf("After clear, s: %v, len(s): %d, cap(s): %d\n", s, len(s), cap(s))
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
s: [first second third], len(s): 3, cap(s): 3
After clear, s: [  ], len(s): 3, cap(s): 3
```

- Zero value for a string is an empty string `" "`.
