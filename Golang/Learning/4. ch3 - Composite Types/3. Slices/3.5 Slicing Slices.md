# Slicing Slices

- When we take a slice from a slice, we are not making a copy of the data.
- Instead, we now have two variables that are sharing memory.
- Means that changes to an element in a slice effect all slices that share that element.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}
	y := x[:2]
	z := x[1:]
	d := x[1:3]
	e := x[:]

	fmt.Println("x: ", x)
	fmt.Println("y: ", y)
	fmt.Println("z: ", z)
	fmt.Println("d: ", d)
	fmt.Println("e: ", e)

	// slices with overlapping storage
	fmt.Println("Slices with overlapping storage")
	x[1] = "y"
	y[0] = "x"
	z[1] = "z"
	fmt.Println("x: ", x)
	fmt.Println("y: ", y)
	fmt.Println("z: ", z)

}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
x:  [a b c d]
y:  [a b]
z:  [b c d]
d:  [b c]
e:  [a b c d]
Slices with overlapping storage
x:  [x y z d]
y:  [x y]
z:  [y z d]
```

- Changing `x` modified both `y` and `z`, while changes to `y` and `z` modified `x`.

## `append` makes overlapping slices more confusing

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}
	y := x[:2]
	fmt.Printf("cap(x): %d, cap(y): %d\n", cap(x), cap(y))
	fmt.Println("y (before append): ", y)
	y = append(y, "z")
	fmt.Println("x: ", x)
	fmt.Println("y: ", y)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
cap(x): 4, cap(y): 4
y (before append):  [a b]
x:  [a b z d]
y:  [a b z]
```

- Whenever we take a slice from another slice, 
  - the subslice's capacity is set to the capacity of the original slice, minus the starting offset of the subslice within the original slice.
  - This means elements of the original slice beyond the end of the subslice, including unused capacity, are shared by both slices.
- Both have capacity 4, meaning `y` can grow to 4 elements without needing reallocation.
- Since `y` has available capacity, `"z"` is added to position 2 in the underlying array. This modifies the shared array, which is also used by `x`.
- `y` becomes `["a", "b", "z"]`
- `x` becomes `["a", "b", "z", "d"]` because `"z"` overwrote the value at index 2 ("c").

## More confusing slices

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
    // create a string type slice with 0 length, and 5 capacity
	x := make([]string, 0, 5)
	x = append(x, "a", "b", "c", "d")
	y := x[:2]
	z := x[2:]
	fmt.Printf("cap(x): %d, cap(y): %d, cap(z): %d\n", cap(x), cap(y), cap(z))
	y = append(y, "i", "j", "k")
	x = append(x, "x")
	z = append(z, "z")
	fmt.Printf("x: %v, y: %v, z: %v\n", x, y, z)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
cap(x): 5, cap(y): 5, cap(z): 3
x: [a b i j z], y: [a b i j z], z: [i j z]
```

### Code  Walkthrough

**First Append**

```go
x = append(x, "a", "b", "c", "d")
```

- Adding 4 elements (from length 0 → 4) still ≤ cap (5), so **no new array allocation**.
- **Underlying array** now: `["a", "b", "c", "d", ""]`.
- **x.len** = 4, **x.cap** = 5.

------

**Creating Sub-Slices**

```go
y := x[:2]
z := x[2:]
```

- `y` starts at index 0 with length 2 → **y.len** = 2
   and cap = original cap(5) − 0 = 5.

- `z` starts at index 2 with length = 4−2 = 2 → **z.len** = 2
   and cap = 5 − 2 = 3 .

- At this point:

  ```
  cap(x): 5, cap(y): 5, cap(z): 3
  ```

------

**Appending to `y`**

```go
y = append(y, "i", "j", "k")
```

- `y`’s length grows from 2 → 5, still ≤ its cap (5).
- No new array is allocated; the underlying array is mutated at indices 2, 3, 4.
- **Underlying array** becomes `["a", "b", "i", "j", "k"]`.

Because `x`, `y`, and `z` all point into this same array, they see those changes.

------

**Appending to `x`**

```go
x = append(x, "x")
```

- `x.len` goes from 4 → 5 ≤ cap(5).
- Overwrites the element at index 4 of the shared array.
- **Underlying array** now: `["a", "b", "i", "j", "x"]`.

------

**Appending to `z`**

```go
z = append(z, "z")
```

- `z.len` goes from 2 → 3 ≤ cap(3).
- `z` starts at underlying index 2, so appending writes at index 2+2=4.
- **Underlying array** becomes `["a", "b", "i", "j", "z"]`.

------

**Final Views**

```go
fmt.Printf("x: %v, y: %v, z: %v\n", x, y, z)
```

All three slices now view the same contents of the backing array, albeit with different start/lengths:

- **x** (len 5): `[a b i j z]`
- **y** (len 5): `[a b i j z]` 
- **z** (len 3): `[i j z]`

---

## The full slice expression protects against `append`

- In Go, a **full slice expression** `a[low:high:max]` lets us explicitly control the resulting slice’s capacity as `max – low`, rather than inheriting the capacity of the original slice.
  - This extra `max` index is what “protects against append” by bounding how far we can grow the subslice before Go must allocate a new array.
- By limiting the capacity of a subslice, we “protect” the underlying array from being modified by future `append` calls on that subslice once its capacity is exceeded.
- In the following example, `y := x[:2:2]` and `z := x[2:4:4]` both get a capacity of 2, so appending three elements to each forces them to allocate new backing arrays, preventing those appends from mutating `x`’s original array.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := make([]string, 0, 5)
	x = append(x, "a", "b", "c", "d")
    
    // low = 0, high = 2, max = 2, cap(y) = 2
    y := x[:2:2] // y : [a b]
    
    // low = 2, high = 4, max = 4, cap(z) = 2
    z := x[2:4:4] // z : [c d]
    
    
	fmt.Printf("cap(x): %d, cap(y): %d, cap(z): %d\n", cap(x), cap(y), cap(z))
    
    // this would grown y.length from 2 -> 5, exceeding cap = 2.
    // go allocates a new underlying array of szie, copies "a", "b" into it, then appends, "i", "j", "k"
    // y will now refer to the new array:
    // ["a", "b", "i", "j", "k"]
	y = append(y, "i", "j", "k")
	x = append(x, "x")
	z = append(z, "z")
	fmt.Printf("x: %v, y: %v, z: %v\n", x, y, z)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
cap(x): 5, cap(y): 2, cap(z): 2
x: [a b c d x], y: [a b i j k], z: [c d z]
```
