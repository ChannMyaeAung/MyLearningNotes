# Slices vs Array 

The fundamental difference:

**Arrays:**

- Have a **fixed size** determined at compile time.
- The size is part of the array's type (e.g., `[3]int` is a different type than `[4]int`).
- Are **value types**. When we pass an array to a function or assign it to another variable, the entire array is copied.

**Slices:**

- Are **dynamically sized**, flexible views onto the elements of an underlying array.
- Don't store data directly; they describe a section of an array. A slice header contains a pointer to the underlying array, a length, and a capacity.
- Are **reference types** (conceptually). When we pass or assign a slice, the slice header is copied, but the copy *still points to the same underlying array*. Modifications made through one slice variable can be seen through others pointing to the same array section.
