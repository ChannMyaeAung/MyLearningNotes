# Thin vs Fat Pointers

- **Thin pointers** (in C, for example) store only a single memory address, pointing to one element of data. 
  - They carry no information about how many elements lie beyond that address.
- **Fat pointers** augment the raw address with additional metadata.
  - commonly the length of the data region, and sometimes capacity or type information so that code can do safe bounds checks or know how far it can grow without another allocation.
- A Go slice is often called a "fat pointer" 
  - because, unlike a traditional pointer in C or C++, it doesn't just store a memory address. 
  - Instead, a Go slice internally holds **three pieces of information**:  
    - **Pointer to the underlying array:** This is the actual memory address of the first element of the array that the slice is viewing. This is the "pointer" part.
    - **Length (len):** This is the number of elements currently accessible through the slice.
    - **Capacity (cap):** This is the total number of elements in the underlying array, starting from the element the slice points to, that are available for the slice to grow into without needing to reallocate a new underlying array.
