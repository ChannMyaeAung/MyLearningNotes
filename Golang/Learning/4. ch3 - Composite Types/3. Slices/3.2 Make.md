`make`

- `make` allows us to specify the type, length and optionally, the capacity.
- If we know how large our slice needs to be, but don't know what those values will be when we are writing the program, use `make`.
- Use `make` with a zero length and a specified capacity. 
  - This allows us to use `append` to add items to the slice.
  - If the number of items turns out to be smaller, we won't have an extraneous zero value at the end.
  - if the number of items is larger, our code will not panic.

- One should never specify a capacity that's less than the length. It's a compile-time error to do so with a constant of numeric literal.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// this creates an int slice with a length of 5 and a capacity of 5
	// since it has a length of 5, x[0] thru x[4] are valid elements and they are all initialized to 0
	x := make([]int, 5)

	// 10 is placed at the end of the slice after the zero values in the elements 0-1
	x = append(x, 10)
	fmt.Println("x after appending 10: ", x)
	fmt.Printf("Len: %d, Cap: %d\n", len(x), cap(x))

	// this creates an int slice with a length of 5 and a capacity of 10
	y := make([]int, 5, 10)
	fmt.Printf("y: %v, len: %d, cap: %d\n", y, len(y), cap(y))

	// we can also create a slice with zero length but a capacity that's greater than zerl
	z := make([]int, 0, 10)

	// since the length is 0, we can't directly index into it
	// but we can append to it
	z = append(z, 5, 6, 7, 8)
	fmt.Printf("z: %v, len: %d, cap: %d\n", z, len(z), cap(z))
}
```

x after appending 10:  [0 0 0 0 0 10]

y: [0 0 0 0 0], len: 5, cap: 10
z: [5 6 7 8], len: 4, cap: 10
