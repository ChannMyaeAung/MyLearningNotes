# Slices

- We can grow slices as needed. Because the length of a slice is not part of its type.
- This removes the biggest limitations of arrays and allows us to write  a single function that processes slices of any size.
- First thing: we don't specify the size of the slice when we declare it.
- A slice is a sequence of values.
- Each element in a slice is assigned to consecutive memory locations, which makes it quick to read or write these values.
- The length of a slice is the number of consecutive memory locations that have been assigned a value.
- Each slice also has a **capacity**, which is the number of consecutive memory locations reserved. 
  - This can be larger than length.
  - Each time we append to a slice, one or more values is added to the end of the slice.
  - Each value added increases the length by one.
  - When the length reaches the capacity, there's no more room to put values.

- If we try to add additional values when the **length** equals the **capacity**, 
  - The `append` function uses the Go runtime to allocate a new backing array for the slice with a larger capacity.

- The values in the original backing array are 
  - copied to the new one, 
  - the new values are added to the end of the new backing array, and 
  - the slice is updated to refer to the new backing array.

- Finally the updated slice is returned.

```go
// this creates a slice of three ints using a slice literal
var x = []int{10,20,30}

// we can also specify only the indices with non-zero values in the slice literal
var x = []int{1, 5:4, 6, 10: 100, 15}

// Multidimensional slices
var x [][]int
```

- Using `[...]` makes an array. Using `[]` makes a slice.
- A Slice is the first type that isn't comparable. 
  - It's a compile time error to use `==` to see if two slices are identical or `!=` to see if they are different.
- The only thing we can compare a slice with using `==` is `nil`:

```go
fmt.Println(x == nil) // prints true
```

---

**Note**: Since Go `1.21`, the `slices` package in the standard library includes two functions to compare slices.

- `slices.Equal` takes in two slices and returns true if the slices are the same length and all of the elements are equal.
  - It requires the elements of the slice to be comparable.
- `slices.EqualFunc` lets us pass in a function to determine equality and does not require the slice elements to be comparable.

**`slices.Equal`**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"slices"
)

func main() {
	x := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	y := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	z := []int{5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
	// s := []string{"a", "b", "c"}
	// fmt.Println(x == y) // does not compile
	fmt.Println(slices.Equal(x, y))
	fmt.Println(slices.Equal(x, z))
	// fmt.Println(slices.Equal(x, s)) // does not compile
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
true
false
```

**`slices.EqualFunc`**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"slices"
)

type Person struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
}

func main() {
	// two slices of Person with matching names but different ages

	p1 := []Person{
		{"Alice", 30},
		{"Bob", 25},
		{"Charlie", 40},
	}

	p2 := []Person{
		{"Alice", 35},
		{"Bob", 28},
		{"Charlie", 42},
	}

	// define an equality function that compares only the name field
	eqByName := func(p1, p2 Person) bool {
		return p1.Name == p2.Name
	}

	eqByAge := func(p1, p2 Person) bool {
		return p1.Age == p2.Age
	}

	equal := slices.EqualFunc(p1, p2, eqByName)
	fmt.Println("Equal by name:", equal)

	equal = slices.EqualFunc(p1, p2, eqByAge)
	fmt.Println("Equal by age:", equal)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make 
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
Equal by name: true
Equal by age: false
```
