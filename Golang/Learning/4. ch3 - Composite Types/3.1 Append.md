# `append` 

- The built-in function used to grow slices.
- Takes 2 parameters: 
  - A slice of any type 
  - A value of that type
- Returns a slice of the same type which is assigned to the variable that was passed to append.
- It's a compile-time error if we forget to assign the value returned from `append`.
- Go is a **call-by-value** language. Everytime we pass a parameter to a function, Go makes a copy of the slice to the function.
  - The function adds the values to the copy of the slice and returns the copy.
  - We then assign the returned slice back to the variable in the calling function.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var x []int
	fmt.Println("before append:", x)
	x = append(x, 10)
	fmt.Println("after append:", x)

	// we can append multiple values at once
	x = append(x, 20, 21, 22)
	fmt.Println("After second append:", x)

	// one slice is appended to another by using ... operator to expand the source slice into individual values
	y := []int{30, 31, 32}
	x = append(x, y...)
	fmt.Println("After third append:", x)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
before append: []
after append: [10]
After second append: [10 20 21 22]
After third append: [10 20 21 22 30 31 32]
```
