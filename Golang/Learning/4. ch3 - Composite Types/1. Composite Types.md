# Composite Types in Go

- Composite types in Go are types whose values are composed from other types, enabling us to build complex data structures by combining simpler ones. 
- The Go language specification defines eight composite kinds
  - array, struct, pointer, function, interface, slice, map, and channel.
  - Each constructed via type literals or declarations.
