# Literals Are Untyped

- While we can't add two integer variables together if they are declared to be of different types of integers, 
  - Go lets us use an integer literal in floating-point expressions or even assign an integer literal to a floating-point variable as literals in Go are untyped.
- But, we can't assign a literal string to a variable with a numeric type or a literal number to a string variable, nor can we assign a  `float` literal to an `int`.
- These are all flagged by the compiler as errors.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var x float64 = 10
	var y float64 = 200.3 * 5
	fmt.Println("x: ", x)
	fmt.Println("y: ", y)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
x:  10
y:  1001.5
```
