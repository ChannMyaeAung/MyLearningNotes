# Introduction

- A repository is a place in a version control system where the source code for a project is stored.

- A module is a bundle of Go source code that's distributed and versioned as a single unit. (Stored in a repository).

- A **package** in Go is the unit of code organization and compilation.

  ```go
  package foobar
  ```

  - `foobar` is the pacakge name. Files in the same directory must share the same package name. 

  `main` Package is a special package produces a standalone executable. It must define a `fun main()` entry point.

- Exported vs. Unexported:

  - **Exported** identifiers start with an uppercase letter (e.g. `func Serve()` or `type Client`).
  - **Unexported** identifiers start lowercase and are visible only within the package.

- Directory Layout 

  - One directory = one package. Subdirectories become separate packages.

    ```go
    myapp/
      ├── go.mod
      ├── cmd/
      │   └── myapp/
      │       └── main.go    // package main
      └── pkg/
          └── auth/
              ├── auth.go    // package auth
              └── auth_test.go
    ```

- **Imports**:

  ```go
  import (
      "fmt"               // standard library
      "github.com/user/mypkg"  // external package from module
  )
  
  // Aliasing 
  import m "math/rand" // refer to functions as m.Int()
  
  // Blank imports 
  import _ "github.com/lib/pq" // executes the package's `init()` (often for side-effects like registering a driver) without binding any names
  ```
