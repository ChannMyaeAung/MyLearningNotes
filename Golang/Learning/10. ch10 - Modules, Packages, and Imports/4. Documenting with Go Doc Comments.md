# Documenting the Code with Go Doc Comments 

- An important part of creating a module for others to use is documenting it properly.

**A package-level comment**

```go
// Package convert provides various utilities to
// make it easy to convert money from one currency to another 
package convert 
```

**A struct comment**

- To make a link to another package whether or not it is in the current module, put the package path within brackets ([ and ])
- When including text that links to a web page, put the text within brackets ([ and ]). 
  - At the end of the comment block, declare the mappings between your text and their URLs with the format `// [TEXT]: URL`. 

```go
// Money represents the combination of an amount of money 
// and the currency the money is in 
//
// the value is stored using a [github.com/shopspring/decimal.Decimal]
type Money struct {
    Value decimal.Decimal 
    Currency string
}
```



**A well-commented function**

```go
// Convert converts the value of one currency to another
//
// It has two parameters: a Money instance with the value to convert,
// and a string that represents the currency to convert to.
// Convert returns the converted currency 
// and any errors encountered from unknown or unconvertible 
//
// If an error is returned, the Money instance is set to the zero value.
//
// Supported currencies are:
//	- USD - US Dollar 
//	- CAD - Canadian Dollar
//	- EUR - Euro 
//	- INR - Indian Rupee 
//
// More information on exchange rates can be found at [Investopedia].
//

func Convert(from Money, to string) (Money, error){
    // ... 
}
```
