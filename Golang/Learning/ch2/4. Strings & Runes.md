# Strings and Runes

- Strings in Go are immutable, read-only slices of bytes, effectively a sequence of UTF-8–encoded data, that the language and runtime treat as text containers, supporting both interpreted (`"..."`) and raw (``...``) literal forms.
  - We can reassign the value of a string variable but we cannot change the value of the string that is assigned to it.

```go
s1 := "hello"
s2 := s1 + " world" // Creates a new string "hello world", s1 remains "hello"
// s1[0] = 'H'       // Error: cannot assign to s1[0] (strings are immutable)
```

- Because strings are byte sequences, indexing a string (`s[i]`) accesses the individual byte at that index, not necessarily a character. If the string contains multi-byte UTF-8 characters, indexing might give us only part of a character.
- To work with individual Unicode characters (code points), Go uses the `rune` type.

- The `rune` type is an alias for the `int32` type that represents a single Unicode code point, just as `byte` is an alias for `uint8`.
  - rune literals are enclosed in single quotes and support escape sequences (`\n`, `\u1234`, etc.) to specify any valid code point.
- Converting between strings and runes (or byte slices) requires explicit conversions.
  - e.g., `[]rune(s)` or `runeVal := 'h'`—and allows correct handling of multibyte characters.
- Because strings are UTF-8 byte sequences, converting a string to a rune slice decodes its code points:

```go
runes := []rune(s) // []rune converts UTF-8 bytes into runes
```

- Conversely, `string(runes)` re-encodes runes back into a UTF-8 string. 

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// we have to include non-ASCII Unicode characters, otherwise both measurements will be identical
	str := "Hello世界" // Hello + Chinese characters for world
	fmt.Println("Length in bytes: ", len(str))

	runes := []rune(str)
	fmt.Println("Length in runes: ", len(runes))
	fmt.Printf("First character: %c\n", runes[0])
}
```

1. **String length in bytes (`len(str)`)**:
   - Measures the raw byte count of the string.
   - Each ASCII character takes exactly 1 byte.
2. **Length in runes (`len([]rune(str))`)**:
   - Counts the number of Unicode code points.
   - For ASCII characters, each character is also a single code point.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
Length in bytes:  11
Length in runes:  7
First character: H
```

- Length in bytes: 11 (5 for "Hello" + 6 for "世界")
- Length in runes: 7 (5 for "Hello" + 2 for "世界")

This happens because characters like "世" and "界" require 3 bytes each in UTF-8 encoding, but each represents a single Unicode code point (rune).
