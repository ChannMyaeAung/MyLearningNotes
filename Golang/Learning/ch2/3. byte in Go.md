# Understanding `byte` in Go

- In Go, `byte` is an alias for `uint8`, which is an 8-bit unsigned integer with values from 0 to 255. 
- This type is used extensively when dealing with:
  1. **Raw data**: Reading files, network packets, etc.
  2. **ASCII text**: Representing single ASCII characters.
  3. **UTF-8 encoding**: Processing text, since Go strings are UTF-8 encoded by default.

```go
s := "Hello"
b := []byte(s)  // string -> []byte (UTF-8 copy)
```

- This line converts the string "Hello" to a slice of bytes, where each byte represents the UTF-8 encoded form of each character. 
- For ASCII characters like those in "Hello", each character is represented by a single byte:
  - 'H' = 72 (in decimal)
  - 'e' = 101
  - 'l' = 108
  - 'l' = 108
  - 'o' = 111
- `b[0]` will yield `72`.
