# `:=` Operator

- A short variable declaration syntax, used exclusively inside functions to 
  - **declare one or more new variables** and 
  - **initialize** them in a single statement, 
  - with the compiler **inferring their types** from the right-hand side expressions.

- **Type Inference**: The variableâ€™s type is deduced from its initializer. For `x := 42`, `x` becomes an `int`; for `s := "Go"`, `s` becomes a `string`, eliminating the need to write out the type explicitly.
- We can only use `:=` inside functions. 
  - Cannot use it for package-level variable declarations (outside of functions), where we must use the `var` keyword.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a, b := 10, 20

	fmt.Println("a: ", a)
	fmt.Println("b: ", b)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ls
go.mod  hello.go  hello_world  Makefile
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
a:  10
b:  20
```
