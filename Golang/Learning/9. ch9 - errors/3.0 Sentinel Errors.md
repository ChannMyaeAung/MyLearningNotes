# Sentinel Errors 

- Sentinel errors are one of the few variables that are declared at the package level. 
- Sentinel errors are usually used to indicate that we cannot start or continue processing.
  - E.g., the standard library includes a package for processing ZIP files, archive/zip.
  - The package defines several sentinel errors, including `ErrFormat` , which is returned when data that doesn't represent a ZIP file is passed in.

```go
package main

import (
	"archive/zip"
	"bytes"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	data := []byte("This is not a zip file")
	notAZipFile := bytes.NewReader(data)
	_, err := zip.NewReader(notAZipFile, int64(len(data)))
	if err == zip.ErrFormat {
		fmt.Println("Told you so! This is not a zip file.")
	}
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
Told you so! This is not a zip file.
```
