# Using for-range and Channels

- We can also read from a channel by using a `for - range` loop.

```go
for v:= range ch{
    fmt.Println(v)
}
```

- Unlike other `for - range` loops. there's only a single variable declared for the channel, which is value. 
- The loop continues until the channel is closed, or until a `break` or `return` statement is reached.

# Closing a Channel 

- When done writing to a channel, we can close it using the built-in `close` function.
- Once a channel is closed, any attempts to write to it or close it again will panic.
- However, attempting to read from a closed channel always succeeds.
- If the channel is buffered and some values haven't been read yet, they will be returned in order. 
- If unbuffered or the buffered channel has no more values, the zero value for the channel's type is returned.
- Use the comma `ok` idiom to detect whether a channel has been closed.
- if `ok` is set to true, the channel is open. If set to `false`, the channel is closed.

```go
close(ch)
```

```go
v, ok := <-ch 
```

## Code Example #1

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// 1. Create a buffered channel with a capacity of 2 and send two values
	ch := make(chan int, 2)
	ch <- 1
	ch <- 2

	// 2. close the channel
	close(ch)

	// 3. Attempt to close it again: should panic
	func() {
		defer func() {
			if r := recover(); r != nil {
				fmt.Println("panic on double close:", r)
			}
		}()
		close(ch)
	}()

	// 4. Attempt to send to the closed channel: should panic
	func() {
		defer func() {
			if r := recover(); r != nil {
				fmt.Println("panic on send after ch closed: ", r)
			}
		}()
		ch <- 30
	}()

	// 5. Read remaining buffered values, then one more to get the zero value
	fmt.Println("\nReading from closed buffered channel:")
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		v, ok := <-ch
		fmt.Printf(" receive #%d: value=%v, ok=%v\n", i+1, v, ok)
	}

	// 6. Unbuffered channel: close immediately, then read
	uch := make(chan string)
	close(uch)
	v2, ok2 := <-uch
	fmt.Println("\nReading from closed unbuffered channel:")
	fmt.Printf(" value=%q, ok=%v\n", v2, ok2)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
panic on double close: close of closed channel
panic on send after ch closed:  send on closed channel

Reading from closed buffered channel:
 receive #1: value=1, ok=true
 receive #2: value=2, ok=true
 receive #3: value=0, ok=false

Reading from closed unbuffered channel:
 value="", ok=false
```

## Code Example #2

- **Description:** Sends a fixed number of values, then closes the channel.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int)

	// Producer goroutine
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
			ch <- i // send i on the channel
		}
		close(ch) // close the channel when done
	}()

	// for-range automatically exits when ch is closed and drained
	for v := range ch {
		fmt.Println("Received: ", v)
	}

	fmt.Println("Channel closed, loop exited.")
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Received:  0
Received:  1
Received:  2
Received:  3
Received:  4
Channel closed, loop exited.
```

## Code Example #3

- **Description**: Fan-out/fan-in with a buffered channel and manual close.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	ch := make(chan string, 3) // buffered channel with capacity 3

    // wg tracks how many worker goroutines are still running
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Start 3 works that read from ch until it's closed
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		wg.Add(1) // increment the WaitGroup counter
		go func(id int) {
            // when ch is closed and emptied, range exits, and the goroutine prints its exiting line and calls wg.Done()
			defer wg.Done()
			for msg := range ch {
				fmt.Printf("worker %d got message %s\n", id, msg)
			}
			fmt.Printf("workder %d: channel closed, exiting\n", id)
		}(i)
	}

	// send 5 msgs, then close
	for _, msg := range []string{"alpha", "beta", "charlie", "delta", "echo"} {
		ch <- msg
		fmt.Println("sent: ", msg)
	}
	close(ch) // no more sends allowed

	// Wait for all workers to finish
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("all workers done")
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
sent:  alpha
sent:  beta
worker 1 got message alpha
sent:  charlie
sent:  delta
sent:  echo
worker 1 got message delta
worker 1 got message echo
workder 1: channel closed, exiting
worker 3 got message charlie
workder 3: channel closed, exiting
worker 2 got message beta
workder 2: channel closed, exiting
all workers done
```
