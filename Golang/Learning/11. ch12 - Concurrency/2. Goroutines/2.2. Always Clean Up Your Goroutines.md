# Always Clean up Your Goroutines

- Whenever we launch a goroutine funciton, we must make sure that it will eventually exit.
- Unlike variables, the Go runtime can't detect that a goroutine will never be used again.
- If a goroutine doesn't exit, all the memory allocated for variables on its stack remains allocated and
  - any memory allocated on the heap that is rooted in the goroutine's stack variables cannot be garbage collected. 
  - It is called a **goroutine leak**.

---

## Code Example #1

- We should never use a goroutine to generate a list of numbers.
- It's too simple of an operation.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func countTo(max int) <-chan int {
	ch := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < max; i++ {
			ch <- i
		}
		close(ch)
	}()
	return ch
}

func main() {
	for i := range countTo(10) {
		// if we exit the loop early, the goroutine blocks forever, waiting for a value to be read from the channel
		if i > 5 {
			break
		}
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
main.go
go vet ./...
go build

## Using the Context to Terminate Goroutines

- To solve the `countTo` goroutine leak, we need a way to tell the goroutine that it's time to stop processing. 
- We can solve this in Go by using a `context`.
- In the following code:
  - The `countTo` is modified to take a `context.Context` in addition to `max`.
  - It's now a `for - select` loop with two cases, one tries to write to `ch`, the other case checks the channel returned by the `Done` method on the context.
    - If it returns a value, we exit the `for - select` loop and the goroutine.
  - How do we get the `Done` channel to return a value? It's triggered via `context cancellation`.
  - We use `defer` to call `cancel` when the main function exits.
    - This closes the channel returned by `Done`, and since a closed channel always returns a value, it ensures that the goroutine running `countTo` exits.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
)

// countTo returns a read-only channel that will emit integers [0, max).
// It spawns a goroutine that sends each number on the channel unless the
// provided context is canceled, and then closes the channel when done.
func countTo(ctx context.Context, max int) <-chan int {
	ch := make(chan int)
	go func() {
        // ensure channel is closed when this goroutine exits
		defer close(ch)
		for i := 0; i < max; i++ {
			select {
            // if the context is canceled, stop early
			case <-ctx.Done():
				return
            // otherwise send the next integer    
			case ch <- i:
				// no-op: move on to next iteration
			}
		}
	}()
    // return the channel immediately (goroutine runs in background)
	return ch
}

func main() {
     // create a cancellable context
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
    
    // ensure resources are cleaned up on exit
	defer cancel()
	ch := countTo(ctx, 10)
	for i := range ch {
		if i > 5 {
			break
		}
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
    // Note: breaking the range loop does not close the channel;
    // the counting goroutine will still run unless ctx is canceled.
    // Because we deferred cancel(), we now signal cancellation,
    // causing the goroutine to exit and close the channel.
}
```
