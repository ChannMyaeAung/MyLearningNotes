# Exercise #2

2. Create a function that launches two goroutines. Each goroutine writes 10 numbers to its own channel. Use a `for select` loop to read from both channels, printing out the number and the goroutine that wrote the value. Make sure that your function exits after all values are read and that none of your goroutines leak.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// launchTwo starts two goroutines, each writing 10 integers to its own channel.
// It then reads from both channels using a select loop, printing the value and
// which goroutine produced it. The function returns only after all values are
// consumed, ensuring no goroutines leak.
func launchTwo() {
	// Create two channels: one for each producer goroutine
	ch1 := make(chan int)
	ch2 := make(chan int)

	// Goroutine #1: Writes 10 numbers to ch1 and then closes it
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
			ch1 <- i
		}
		close(ch1)
	}()

	// Goroutine #2: Writes 10 numbers to ch2 and then closes it
	go func() {
		for i := 10; i < 20; i++ {
			ch2 <- i
		}
		close(ch2)
	}()

	// Count how many channels have closed; once both are closed, we exit
	closedCount := 0

	// Loop until we've seen both channels close.
	for closedCount < 2 {
		select {
		case v, ok := <-ch1:
			if !ok {
				// ch1 is closed, disable this case by setting ch1 to nil
				ch1 = nil
				closedCount++
			} else {
				fmt.Printf("Goroutine 1 wrote: %d\n", v)
			}
		case v, ok := <-ch2:
			if !ok {
				ch2 = nil
				closedCount++
			} else {
				fmt.Printf("Goroutine 2 wrote: %d\n", v)
			}
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	launchTwo()
	fmt.Println("All values consumed, exiting.")
}
```
