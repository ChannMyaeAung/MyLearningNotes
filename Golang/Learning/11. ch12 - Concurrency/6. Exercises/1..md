# Exercise #1

1. Create a function that launches three goroutines that communicate using a channel . The first two goroutines each write 10 numbers to the channel . The third goroutine reads all the numbers from the channel and prints them out. The function should exit when all values have been printed out. Make sure that none of the goroutines leak. You can create additional goroutines if needed.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func launchAndProcess() {
	ch := make(chan int)

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(2)

    // First writer goroutine
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
			ch <- i
		}
	}()

    // Second writer goroutine 
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		for i := 11; i < 20; i++ {
			ch <- i
		}
	}()

    // Start a separate goroutine whose only job is to wait for both writers
    //  to finish and then close the channel so the reader can terminate.
	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		close(ch)
	}()

     // Create a channel to signal when the reader is done.
	done := make(chan struct{})

    // Reader goroutine: reads from ch until it's closed, prints each value,
    // then signals via done when finished.
	go func() {
		for v := range ch {
			fmt.Println(v)
		}
		close(done)
	}()

    // Block until the reader signals it has consumed and printed all values.
	<-done
}

func main() {
	launchAndProcess()
	fmt.Println("All done!")
}
```
