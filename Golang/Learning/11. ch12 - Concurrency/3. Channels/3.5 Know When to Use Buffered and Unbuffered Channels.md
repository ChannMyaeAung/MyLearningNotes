# Know When to Use Buffered and Unbuffered Channels 

- Buffered channels are useful 
  - when we know how many goroutines we have launched,
  - want to limit the number of goroutines we will launch or
  - want to limit the amount of work that is queued up.
- Buffered channels work great
  - when we either want to gather data back from a set of goroutines that we have launched or want to limit concurrent usage.
  - Also helpful for managing the amount of work a system has queued up, preventing the services from falling behind and becoming overwhelmed. 

---

## Code Example 

- In this example:
  - we are processing the first 10 results on a channel.
  - Launch 10 goroutines, each of which writes its results to a buffered channel.
  - We know exactly how many goroutines have been launched, and we want each goroutine to exit as soon as it finishes its work.
  - This means we can create a buffered channel with one space for each launched goroutine, and have each goroutine write data to this goroutine without blocking.
  - When all values have been read, we return the results, and ensuring that we aren't leaking any goroutines.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func process(v int) int {
	// simulate latency and square it
	time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
	return v * v
}

func processChannel(ch chan int) []int {
	const conc = 10
	results := make(chan int, conc)

	// launch exactly conc workers
	for i := 0; i < conc; i++ {
		go func() {
			v := <-ch             // read one input
			results <- process(v) // send into buffered channel
		}()
	}

	// collect exactly conc results
	var out []int
	for i := 0; i < conc; i++ {
		out = append(out, <-results)
	}
	return out
}

func main() {
	const conc = 10
	in := make(chan int, conc)

    // feed the input channel with the first 10 values
	for i := 1; i <= conc; i++ {
		in <- i
	}
	close(in)

	results := processChannel(in)
	fmt.Println("Processed results: ", results)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Processed results:  [1 100 4 9 16 81 64 25 36 49]
```
