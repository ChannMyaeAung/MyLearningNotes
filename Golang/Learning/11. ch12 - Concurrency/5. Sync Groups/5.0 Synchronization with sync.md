# Synchronization with `sync`

- Sometimes we need to wait for a set of goroutines to finish.
- We can use `sync.WaitGroup`.
- **`sync.WaitGroup`:**
  - Doesn't need to be initialized, just declared, as its zero value is useful.
  - Used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish executing.
  - `Add(delta int)`: Increments a counter that tracks how many concurrent operations (usually goroutines) the program must wait for before unblocking a `Wait()` call.
    - Usually called once, with the number of goroutines that will be launched.
    - Calling `wg.Add(1)` before spawning a goroutine ensures that `wg.Wait()` will block until that goroutine signals completion with `wg.Done()`
  - `Done()`: Decrements the counter (usually called by the goroutine when it finishes, often via `defer wg.Done()`).
  - `Wait()`: Blocks until the counter becomes zero.
  

## Code Example #1

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

var wg sync.WaitGroup

func worker(id int) {
	defer wg.Done()
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d working\n", id)
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
}

func main() {
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go worker(i)
	}
	wg.Wait() // block until all wg.Done() calls happen
	fmt.Println("all workers done")
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Worker 3 working
Worker 1 working
Worker 2 working
all workers done
```

## Code Example #2

```go
package main

import "sync"

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(3)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		// Simulate some work
		for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
			println("Goroutine 1 working")
		}
	}()
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		// Simulate some work
		for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
			println("Goroutine 2 working")
		}
	}()
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		// Simulate some work
		for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
			println("Goroutine 3 working")
		}
	}()
	wg.Wait()
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
main.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./main
Goroutine 3 working
Goroutine 3 working
Goroutine 3 working
Goroutine 3 working
Goroutine 3 working
Goroutine 2 working
Goroutine 2 working
Goroutine 2 working
Goroutine 2 working
Goroutine 2 working
Goroutine 1 working
Goroutine 1 working
Goroutine 1 working
Goroutine 1 working
Goroutine 1 working
```

## Code Example #3

- When we have multiple goroutines writing to the same channel, we need to make sure that the channel being written to is closed only once.
- A `sync.WaitGroup` is perfect for this.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

// processAndGather reads values from the input channel `in`, processes each
// value with the `processor` function, and returns a slice of all results.
// It launches `num` worker goroutines, each of which reads from `in` until
// itâ€™s closed. A sync.WaitGroup ensures we close the output channel exactly once.
//
// T is the input element type, R is the result type.
func processAndGather[T, R any](in <-chan T, processor func(T) R, num int) []R {
	out := make(chan R, num)
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(num)
	for i := 0; i < num; i++ {
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()
			for v := range in {
				out <- processor(v)
			}
		}()
	}

	// Close `out` once all workers are done.
	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		close(out)
	}()

	// Collect all results.
	var result []R
	for v := range out {
		result = append(result, v)
	}
	return result
}

func main() {
	// Create and populate the input channel
	in := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
			in <- i
		}
		close(in)
	}()

	square := func(v int) int {
		return v * v
	}

	// Use 3 concurrent workers to process the channel
	results := processAndGather[int, int](in, square, 3)

	fmt.Println("Processed results:", results)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./main
Processed results: [0 9 16 25 36 49 1 4 64 81]
```
