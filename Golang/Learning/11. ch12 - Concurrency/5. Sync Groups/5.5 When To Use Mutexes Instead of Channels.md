# When To Use Mutexes Instead of Channels 

- **Recall**: `mutex` short for mutual exclusion, and its job it to limit the concurrent execution of some code or access to a shared piece of data.
  - This protected part is called **the critical section**.
- Go encourages passing data between goroutines via channels, making the flow of data explicit. 
- Using channels localizes access to a value: one goroutine receives and processes it at a time.
- **Drawbacks of Using Mutexes in Go**:
  - Obscures data flow: No clear indication which goroutine currently owns the protected value. 
  - Makes it harder to understand the order of processing among concurrent operations.
  - Contrasts with Go's philosophy: "Share memory by communicating; do not communicate by sharing memory."
- **When Mutexes Can Be Clearer**:
  - Situations where goroutines only need to read or write a shared value without further processing. 
  - In such cases, protecting the value with a mutex can be simpler than setting up channels and select logic.

## Code Example #1

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// declares a map and then listens on one channel for a function that reads or modifies the map
// and on a context's Done channel to exit
func scoreboardManager(ctx context.Context, in <-chan func(map[string]int)) {
	scoreboard := map[string]int{}
	for {
		select {
		case <-ctx.Done():
			return
		case f := <-in:
			f(scoreboard)
		}
	}
}

type ChannelScoreboardManager chan func(map[string]int)

func NewChannelScoreboardManager(ctx context.Context) ChannelScoreboardManager {
	ch := make(ChannelScoreboardManager)
	go scoreboardManager(ctx, ch)
	return ch
}

func (csm ChannelScoreboardManager) Update(name string, val int) {
	csm <- func(m map[string]int) {
		m[name] = val
	}
}

func (csm ChannelScoreboardManager) Read(name string) (int, bool) {
	type Result struct {
		out int
		ok  bool
	}
	resultCh := make(chan Result)
	csm <- func(m map[string]int) {
		out, ok := m[name]
		resultCh <- Result{out, ok}
	}
	result := <-resultCh
	return result.out, result.ok
}

func main() {
	// make a context that will cancel in 1 second
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)
	defer cancel()

	// start the manager
	mgr := NewChannelScoreboardManager(ctx)

	// do a few updates
	mgr.Update("Alice", 10)
	mgr.Update("Bob", 20)

	if v, ok := mgr.Read("Alice"); ok {
		fmt.Println("Alice: ", v)
	}
	if v, ok := mgr.Read("Bob"); ok {
		fmt.Println("Bob: ", v)
	}

}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Alice:  10
Bob:  20
```

- While this code works, it's cumbersome and allows only a single reader at a time.
- A better approach is to use a mutex.
- The first Mutex has two methods,
  - `Lock`: Calling `Lock` causes the current goroutine to pause as long as another goroutine is currently in the critical section.
    - When the critical section is clear, the lock is acquired by the current goroutine and the code in the critical section is executed.
  - `Unlock` - A call to `Unlock` method on the Mutext marks the end of the critical section. 
- The second mutext implementation called `RWMutex`,allows us to have both reader and writer locks.
  - While only one writer can be in the critical section at a time, read locks are shared.
  - Multiple readers can be in the critical section at once.
  - The writer lock is managed with the `Lock` and `Unlock` methods, while the reader lock is managed with `RLock` and `RUnlock` methods.
- Any time we acquire a mutex lock, we must make sure that we release the lock.

## Code Example #2

- In this example, we both acquire and releases the locks within the same method.
- Mutexes in Go aren't **reentrant**. 
  - If a goroutine tries to acquire the same lock twice, it deadlocks, waiting for itself to release the lock.
- Like `sync.WaitGroup` and `sync.Once`, mutexes must never be copied.
- If they are passed to a function or accessed as a field on a struct, it must be via a pointer. If a mutex is copied, its lock won't be shared.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

type MutexScoreboardManager struct {
	l          sync.RWMutex
	scoreboard map[string]int
}

func NewMutexScoreboardManager() *MutexScoreboardManager {
	return &MutexScoreboardManager{
		scoreboard: map[string]int{},
	}
}

func (msm *MutexScoreboardManager) Update(name string, val int) {
	msm.l.Lock()
	defer msm.l.Unlock()
	msm.scoreboard[name] = val
}

func (msm *MutexScoreboardManager) Read(name string) (int, bool) {
	msm.l.RLock()
	defer msm.l.RUnlock()
	val, ok := msm.scoreboard[name]
	return val, ok
}
func main() {
	// make a context that will cancel in 1 second
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)
	defer cancel()

	// start the manager
	mgr := NewMutexScoreboardManager()

	// do a few updates
	mgr.Update("Alice", 10)
	mgr.Update("Bob", 20)

	<-ctx.Done() // wait for the context to finish

	if v, ok := mgr.Read("Alice"); ok {
		fmt.Println("Alice: ", v)
	}
	if v, ok := mgr.Read("Bob"); ok {
		fmt.Println("Bob: ", v)
	}
}
```
