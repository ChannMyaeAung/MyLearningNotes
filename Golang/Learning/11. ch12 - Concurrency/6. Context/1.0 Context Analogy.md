# Context Analogy

Imagine you're in a warehouse, passing a package (a task) through several departments (functions). You attach a **tag** to the package:

- The **tag** contains info like: "must be done in 5 minutes", "this is for user X", or "stop if manager says so".
- Each department can **read the tag** and act accordingly (e.g., stop work if timeout reached).
- If a manager (parent function) says "stop", everyone handling the package stops too.

So yes, it **is** a bit like attaching a tag â€“ not just with metadata (values), but also behavior (timeouts/cancellation).
