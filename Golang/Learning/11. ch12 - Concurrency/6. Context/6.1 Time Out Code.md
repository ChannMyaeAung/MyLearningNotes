# Time Out Code

- One of the things we can do with concurrency in Go is manage how much time a request (or a part of a request) has to run.
- Reaching the timeout cancels the context.
- The `Done` method on the context returns a channel that returns a value when the context is cancelled by either timing out or when the context's cancel method is called.
- We can create a timed context by using the `WithTimeout` function in the context package. 
- Once the context is setup, we run the worker in a goroutine and then use `select` to choose between two cases. 
  - The first case reads the value from the `out` channel when the work completes.
  - The second case waits for the channel returned by the `Done` method to return a value. 
- If `timeLimit` exits before the goroutine finishes processing, the goroutine continues to run, eventually writing the returned value to the buffered channel and exiting.
- If we are waiting for a single goroutine, we can use the context cancellation pattern, but if we are waiting on several goroutines, we need to use a `WaitGroup`.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// timeLimit runs the provided worker function in a goroutine and waits up to
// the given timeout. If the worker returns before the deadline, its result
// and a nil error are returned. Otherwise, timeLimit returns the zero value
// of T and a timeout error.
func timeLimit[T any](worker func() T, limit time.Duration) (T, error) {
	out := make(chan T, 1)

	// Create a context that will be canceled after `limit`.
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), limit)
	defer cancel()

	// Run the worker in its own goroutine.
	go func() {
		out <- worker()
	}()

	// Wait for either the worker to finish or the timeout.
	select {
	case result := <-out:
		return result, nil
	case <-ctx.Done():
		var zero T
		return zero, errors.New("work timed out")
	}
}

func main() {
	fast := func() string {
		time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
		return "fast result"
	}

	slow := func() string {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		return "slow result"
	}

	// Run the fast worker with a 1s timeout
	fmt.Println("Running fast worker with 1s timeout...")
	if res, err := timeLimit(fast, 1*time.Second); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Fast worker error: ", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Fast worker succeeded with: ", res)
	}

	// Run the slow worker with a 1s timeout
	fmt.Println("\nRunning slow worker with 1s timeout...")
	if res, err := timeLimit(slow, 1*time.Second); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Slow worker error: ", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Slow worker succeeded with: ", res)
	}
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
main.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./main
Running fast worker with 1s timeout...

## `context.WithDeadline`

- Takes in an existing context and a `time.Time` that specifies the time when the context is automatically cancelled.
- Like `context.WithTimeout`, it returns a context that automatically triggers a cancellation after the specified time has elapsed as well as a cancellation function.
- We must make sure that the cancellation function returned by `context.WithTimeout` and `context.WithDeadline` is invoked at least once.

## Example Program (`context.WithDeadline`)

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// worker simulates a tasks that takes some time to complete
// It accepts a context to handle cancellation signals
func worker(ctx context.Context) (string, error) {
	fmt.Println("Worker: Starting long-running task...")

	// This select block allows the worker to do its job while also
	// listening for a cancellation signal from the context
	select {
	case <-time.After(3 * time.Second):
		// this case is triggered after 3 seconds, simulating the work finishing
		fmt.Println("Worker: Task finished successfully.")
		return "Task completed", nil
	case <-ctx.Done():
		// this case is triggered if the context is cancelled for any reason
		// deadline reached, timeout, or manual cancellation
		fmt.Println("Worker: Task cancelled.")
		ctx.Err() // returns the reason for cancellation

		// For WithDeadline, this will be context.DeadlineExceeded
		return "", ctx.Err()
	}
}

func main() {
	// Set the absolute deadline
	// We want this op to be complete within the next 2 seconds
	deadline := time.Now().Add(2 * time.Second)
	fmt.Printf("Main: Setting deadline to: %s\n", deadline.Format(time.RFC3339))

	// Create a context with the specified deadline
	ctx, cancel := context.WithDeadline(context.Background(), deadline)
	defer cancel()

	// Run the worker in a goroutine and get the result via a channel
	resultChan := make(chan string)
	errorChan := make(chan error)

	go func() {
		result, err := worker(ctx)
		if err != nil {
			errorChan <- err
			return
		}
		resultChan <- result
	}()

	// Wait for a result from either the worker or the context cancellation
	select {
	case res := <-resultChan:
		fmt.Println("Main: Received result from worker:", res)
	case err := <-errorChan:
		fmt.Println("Main: Worker encountered an error:", err)
	case <-ctx.Done():
		fmt.Println("Main: The deadline was exceeded! the worker was told to stop.")

		// we can inspect the context's error to confirm the reason
		fmt.Println("Main: Context error reason:", ctx.Err())
	}

}
```

```sh
practice ➤ ./practice
Main: Setting deadline to: 2025-06-17T22:34:06+07:00
Worker: Starting long-running task...
Main: The deadline was exceeded! the worker was told to stop.
Main: Context error reason: context deadline exceeded
```

- We can control how long an individual call takes by creating a child context that wraps a parent context 
  - by using `context.WithTimeout` or `context.WithDeadline`.
- Any timeout that we set on the child context is bounded by the timeout set on the parent context.
  - if a parent context times out in 2 seconds, we can declare that a child context times out in 3 seconds, 
  - but when the parent context times out after 2 seconds, so will the child.

```go
ctx := context.Background()
parent, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 2 * time.Second)
defer cancel()
child, cancel2 := context.WithTimeout(parent, 3 * time.Second)
defer cancel2()
start := time.Now()
<-child.Done()
end := time.Now()
fmt.Println(end.Sub(start).Truncate(time.Second))
```

## Nested Timers Program

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()

	// Derive a "parent" context with a 2-second timeout.
    // After 2s, parent.Done() will be closed and parent.Err() == context.DeadlineExceeded.
	parent, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 2*time.Second)
	defer cancel()

	// Derive a "child" context from parent with a 3-second timeout.
    // child will be canceled either when parent times out (after 2s)
    // or when its own 3s deadline elapses—whichever comes first.
	child, cancel2 := context.WithTimeout(parent, 3*time.Second)
	defer cancel2()

	// Record the start time so we can see how long we actually waited.
	start := time.Now()

	// Block until the child context is done (closed).
    //  Because parent times out first (2s), child.Done() will unblock at ~2s.
	<-child.Done()

	// Record the end time and compute the elapsed duration.
	end := time.Now()

	// Print the elapsed time, truncated to the nearest second.
    // Expect to see "2s" because the parent deadline fires first.
	fmt.Println(end.Sub(start).Truncate(time.Second))
}
```

```sh
practice ➤ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
practice ➤ ./practice
2s
```



## Our `httpbin` program

- this time, we are adding a timeout to the context that's used to control how long the goroutines run.
- If we want the option of returning the error for the cancellation cause, 
  - we need to wrap a context created by `WithTimeout` or `WithDeadline` in a context created by `WithCancelCause`.
- But if we want to return a custom sentinel error when a context times out, use the `context.WithTimeoutCause` or `context.WithDeadlineCause` functions instead.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func makeRequest(ctx context.Context, url string) (*http.Response, error) {
	req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, http.MethodGet, url, nil)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
}

func main() {
	ctx, cancelFuncParent := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 3*time.Second)
	defer cancelFuncParent()

	ctx, cancelFuncChild := context.WithCancelCause(ctx)
	defer cancelFuncChild(nil)

	ch := make(chan string)
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(2)

	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		for {
			resp, err := makeRequest(ctx, "http://httpbin.org/status/200,200,200,500")
			if err != nil {
				cancelFuncChild(fmt.Errorf("in status goroutine: %w", err))
				return
			}
			if resp.StatusCode == http.StatusInternalServerError {
				cancelFuncChild(errors.New("bad status"))
				return
			}
			ch <- "success from status"
			time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
		}
	}()

	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		for {
			resp, err := makeRequest(ctx, "http://httpbin.org/delay/1")
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println("in delay goroutine:", err)
				cancelFuncChild(fmt.Errorf("in delay goroutine: %w", err))
				return
			}
			ch <- "success from delay: " + resp.Header.Get("date")
		}
	}()
loop:
	for {
		select {
		case s := <-ch:
			fmt.Println("in main:", s)
		case <-ctx.Done():
			fmt.Println("in main: cancelled with cause: ", context.Cause(ctx), "err:", ctx.Err())
			break loop
		}
	}
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("context cause:", context.Cause(ctx))
}
```

- Now our program will exit if a 500 status code is returned or if we don't get a 500 status code within 3 seconds.

```sh
practice ➤ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
practice ➤ ./practice
in main: cancelled with cause:  bad status err: context canceled
in delay goroutine: Get "http://httpbin.org/delay/1": context canceled
context cause: bad status
practice ➤ ./practice
in main: success from status
in main: cancelled with cause:  context deadline exceeded err: context deadline exceeded
in delay goroutine: Get "http://httpbin.org/delay/1": context deadline exceeded
context cause: context deadline exceeded
```

- We can see that the error returned by `context.Cause` is the same error that's returned by the `Err` method: `context.DeadlineExceeded`.
