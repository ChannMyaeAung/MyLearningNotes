# Time Out Code

- One of the things we can do with concurrency in Go is manage how much time a request (or a part of a request) has to run.
- Reaching the timeout cancels the context.
- The `Done` method on the context returns a channel that returns a value when the context is cancelled by either timing out or when the context's cancel method is called.
- We can create a timed context by using the `WithTimeout` function in the context package. 
- Once the context is setup, we run the worker in a goroutine and then use `select` to choose between two cases. 
  - The first case reads the value from the `out` channel when the work completes.
  - The second case waits for the channel returned by the `Done` method to return a value. 
- If `timeLimit` exits before the goroutine finishes processing, the goroutine continues to run, eventually writing the returned value to the buffered channel and exiting.
- If we are waiting for a single goroutine, we can use the context cancellation pattern, but if we are waiting on several goroutines, we need to use a `WaitGroup`.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// timeLimit runs the provided worker function in a goroutine and waits up to
// the given timeout. If the worker returns before the deadline, its result
// and a nil error are returned. Otherwise, timeLimit returns the zero value
// of T and a timeout error.
func timeLimit[T any](worker func() T, limit time.Duration) (T, error) {
	out := make(chan T, 1)

	// Create a context that will be canceled after `limit`.
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), limit)
	defer cancel()

	// Run the worker in its own goroutine.
	go func() {
		out <- worker()
	}()

	// Wait for either the worker to finish or the timeout.
	select {
	case result := <-out:
		return result, nil
	case <-ctx.Done():
		var zero T
		return zero, errors.New("work timed out")
	}
}

func main() {
	fast := func() string {
		time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
		return "fast result"
	}

	slow := func() string {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		return "slow result"
	}

	// Run the fast worker with a 1s timeout
	fmt.Println("Running fast worker with 1s timeout...")
	if res, err := timeLimit(fast, 1*time.Second); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Fast worker error: ", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Fast worker succeeded with: ", res)
	}

	// Run the slow worker with a 1s timeout
	fmt.Println("\nRunning slow worker with 1s timeout...")
	if res, err := timeLimit(slow, 1*time.Second); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Slow worker error: ", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Slow worker succeeded with: ", res)
	}
}
```
