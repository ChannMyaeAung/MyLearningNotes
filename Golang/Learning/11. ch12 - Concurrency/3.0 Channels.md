# Channels

- A channel is a typed conduit we can send to and receive from.
- Goroutines communicate using channels.
- Like slices and maps, channels are a built-in type created using the `make` function. 
- Like maps, channels are reference types.
  - When passing a channel to a function, we are really passing a pointer to the channel.
  - Zero value for a channel is `nil`.
- We read from a channel by placing the `<-` operator to the left of the channel variable,
- we write to a channel by placing it to the right.

```go
a := <- ch // reads a value from ch and assigns it to a
ch <- b // write the value in b to ch
```

- Each value written to a channel can be read only once.
- If multiple goroutines are reading from the same channel, a value written to the channel will be read by only one of them.

## Code Example #1 

- **Directionality**: `chan<- T` is send-only, `<-chan T` is receive only. 
- **Buffered channels**: `make(chan T, N)` can hold up to `N` elements without blocking the sender. 

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// send-only: inside we can only do pings <- 
func ping(pings chan<- string, msg string) {
	pings <- msg // send msg to pings
}

// receive-only: we can only do <- pings
func pong(pings <-chan string, pongs chan<- string) {
	// unblocks ping, receive msg from pings
    msg := <-pings
	
    // then blocks until main reads from pongs
    // forward to pongs
    pongs <- msg   
}

func main() {
    // create two unbuffered channels
	pings := make(chan string)
	pongs := make(chan string)

    // start two goroutines 
    // ping will send the string "hello" into pings 
    // pong will read from pings, then immediately send that same msg into pongs
	go ping(pings, "hello")
	go pong(pings, pongs)

	fmt.Println(<-pongs)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
hello
```

- Because unbuffered channels synchronize sender & receiver, each send (`<-`) waits for a matching receive before proceeding.
- That guarantees we'll always print exactly one "hello" and never deadlock.
