# `sync.Once`

- Provides a `Do(f func())` method that ensures the function `f` is called exactly once, even if `Do` is called multiple times concurrently. 
- Useful for initialization tasks.

---

## Code Example #1

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

// ensures a function runs only once, even if called multiple times
func syncOnce() {
	var once sync.Once
	initialize := func() {
		fmt.Println("Initialization: only once")
	}

	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		once.Do(initialize)
		fmt.Printf("once.Do called %d times\n", i)
	}
}
func main() {
	syncOnce()
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
main.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./main
Initialization: only once
once.Do called 0 times
once.Do called 1 times
once.Do called 2 times
```

- The `initialize` function runs only on the very first `once.Do(initialize)` call even tho each loop prints that `once.Do` has been called 3 times.
