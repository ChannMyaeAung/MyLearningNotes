# Unbuffered & Buffered channels

- The key difference is whether sends and receives synchronize immediately or can queue up values.

- Use `len` to find out how many values are currently in the buffer.
- Use `cap` to find out the maximum buffer size. The capacity of the buffer cannot be changed. 
- Passing an unbuffered channel to both `len` and `cap` returns 0 as it doesn't have a buffer to store values. 
- Most of the time, we should use unbuffered channels.

## Unbuffered Channels

- An **unbuffered** channel has **no capacity**, so every send (`ch <- x`) blocks until another goroutine is ready to receive (`<-ch`), and every receive blocks until thereâ€™s a send. 
  - This enforces hand-off synchronization.
- **Send blocks** until a receiver is ready.
- **Receive blocks** until a send is ready.
- Great for enforcing strict rendezvous between goroutines.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ch := make(chan string) // unbuffered

	go func() {
		fmt.Println("sender: sending 'hello'")
		ch <- "hello" // blocks here until receiver runs
	}()

	time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Println("receiver: about to receive")
	msg := <-ch // unblocks the sender
	fmt.Println("receiver got: ", msg)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
sender: sending 'hello'
receiver: about to receive
receiver got:  hello
```

- The sender can't complete its send until the receiver actually does the receive.

### Buffered Channels

- These channels buffer a limited number of writes without blocking.
- A **buffered** channel has a fixed **capacity** `N`. 
- We declare one with `make(chan T, N)`. 
- Sends will block *only* when the buffer is full; receives block only when the buffer is empty.
- **Send blocks** only if the buffer is already holding `N` elements.
- **Receive blocks** only if the buffer is empty.
- Useful for decoupling producers and consumers by up to `N` items.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int, 2) // buffered, capacity = 2

	// Two sends fill the buffer immediately without blocking
	ch <- 1
	fmt.Println("sent 1")
	ch <- 2
	fmt.Println("sent 2")

	// A third send would block until a receive happens
	go func() {
		ch <- 3
		fmt.Println("sent 3")
	}()

	fmt.Println("about to receive one value")
	fmt.Println("received", <-ch) // frees up one slot
	// now the background goroutine can send(3) can complete

	fmt.Println("received", <-ch)
	fmt.Println("received", <-ch)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
sent 1
sent 2
about to receive one value
received 1
received 2
sent 3
received 3
```
