# Turn off a case in a select

- When we need to combine data from multiple concurrent sources, the `select` keyword is great . 
- However, we need to properly handle closed channels . 
- If one of the cases in a `select` is reading a closed channel , it will always be successful, returning the zero value. 
- Every time that case is selected , we need to check to make sure that the value is valid and skip the case. 
- If reads are spaced out, our program is going to waste a lot of time reading junk values. 
- Even if there is lots of activity on the nonclosed channels, our program will still spend some portion of its time reading from the closed channel , since `select` chooses a case at random.
- When that happens, we rely on something that looks like an `error` : reading a `nil` channel. 
- Reading from or writing to a `nil` channel causes our code to hang forever. 
- While that is bad if it is triggered by a bug, we can use a `nil` channel to disable a case in a `select` . 
- When we detect that a channel has been closed, set the channel's variable to `nil`. 
- The associated case will no longer run, because the read from the `nil` channel never returns a value .

## Code Example

- Here is a `for - select` loop that reads from two channels until both are closed :

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// create two channels
	in := make(chan int)
	in2 := make(chan int)

    // we will create two producers with different sleep intervals
	// Producer for 'in'
	go func() {
		for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
			in <- i
			time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
		}
		close(in)
	}()

	// Producer for 'in2'
	go func() {
		for i := 10; i <= 12; i++ {
			in2 <- i
			time.Sleep(150 * time.Millisecond)
		}
		close(in2)
	}()
	// count how many channels have been closed
	count := 0

	// loop until we've observed both channels close
	for count < 2 {
		select {
		case v, ok := <-in:
			if !ok {
				// 'in' is closed; disable this case by setting it to nil
				in = nil
				count++
				fmt.Println("in channel closed")
				continue

			}
			fmt.Println("received from in: ", v)
		case v, ok := <-in2:
			if !ok {
				// 'in2' is closed; disable this case by setting it to nil
				in2 = nil
				count++
				fmt.Println("in2 channel closed")
				continue
			}
			fmt.Println("received from in2: ", v)
		}
	}
	fmt.Println("all channels closed, exiting")
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
received from in2:  10
received from in:  1
received from in:  2
received from in2:  11
received from in:  3
in channel closed
received from in2:  12
in2 channel closed
all channels closed, exiting
```

- once `in` was closed and set to `nil`, no more `in` values were ever attempted or printed.
- Similarly, after `in2` closed and was nilled, the loop saw `count==2` and exited.
- That pattern, detecting `ok==false`, setting the channel variable to `nil`, and thus “turning off” that `select` case is the canonical way in Go to stop processing from a channel once it’s closed.
