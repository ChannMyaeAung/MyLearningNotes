# Preventing deadlocks using `select`

- Another advantage of `select` choosing at random is that 
  - It prevents one of the most common causes of deadlocks which is acquiring locks in an inconsistent order.
- If we have two goroutines that both access the same two channels, they must be accessed in the same order in both goroutines, or they will deadlock. 
  - Neither can proceed because they are waiting on each other. 
- **Recall**: In Go an unbuffered channel send (`ch<-v`) blocks until there’s a matching receive (`<-ch`), and a receive blocks until there’s a send.

## Example: Deadlocking goroutines

- If every goroutine in a Go application is deadlocked, the Go runtime kills the program. 

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan int)
	ch2 := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		inGoroutine := 1
		ch1 <- inGoroutine
		fromMain := <-ch2
		fmt.Println("goroutine: ", inGoroutine, fromMain)
	}()
	inMain := 2
	ch2 <- inMain
	fromGoroutine := <-ch1
	fmt.Println("main: ", inMain, fromGoroutine)
}
```

- Goroutine A (the anonymous one) does:
  1. `ch1 <- 1` // send on ch1, blocks until someone reads from `ch1`
  2. `<-ch2` // then waits to receive on ch2
- Goroutine B (main) does:
  1. `ch2 <- 2` // send on `ch2`, blocks until someone reads from `ch2`
  2. `<-ch1` // then waits to receive on `ch1`.
- If A runs first up to step 1, it blocks sending on `ch1`.
- If B then runs step 1, it blocks sending on `ch2`.
- Now A is waiting for `ch2`, B is waiting for `ch1`, neither can make progress → deadlock:
  - A: waiting to send on `ch1`
  - B: waiting to send on `ch2`

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!

## **Example: Using `select` to avoid deadlocks**

- If the channel read and the channel write  in the main goroutine are wrapped in a `select`, deadlock is avoided.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan int)
	ch2 := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		inGoroutine := 1
		ch1 <- inGoroutine
		fromMain := <-ch2
		fmt.Println("goroutine:", inGoroutine, fromMain)
	}()
	inMain := 2
	var fromGoroutine int
	select {
    // send-on-ch2 if the other goroutine is already waiting to read
	case ch2 <- inMain:
        
    // or receive-from-ch1 if the other goroutine has already sent
	case fromGoroutine = <-ch1:
	}
	fmt.Println("main: ", inMain, fromGoroutine)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
main:  2 1
```

- The “magic” of `select` here is that it doesn’t force us into a fixed send-then-receive (or receive-then-send) order
  - whichever side is ready first wins, and the other side unblocks. 
- That breaks the circular wait that would otherwise deadlock two goroutines doing opposite operations on two unbuffered channels.
- The `fmt.Prinln` in goroutine never executes, because that goroutine is paused, waiting for a value to read from `ch2`.
- When the main goroutine exits, the program exits and kills any remaining goroutines.  
- We can solve it by blocking the `main` until the child is done. We can use a `sync.WaitGroup`

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan int)
	ch2 := make(chan int)

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(1)

	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		inGoroutine := 1
		ch1 <- inGoroutine // send 1 to main
		fromMain := <-ch2 // wait for 2 from main
		fmt.Println("goroutine: ", inGoroutine, fromMain)
	}()
	inMain := 2
	var fromGoroutine int
	select {
	// send-on-ch2 if the other goroutine is already waiting to read
	case ch2 <- inMain:
		fromGoroutine = <-ch1

	// or receive-from-ch1 if the other goroutine has already sent
	case fromGoroutine = <-ch1:
		ch2 <- inMain
	}

	fmt.Println("main: ", inMain, fromGoroutine)
	wg.Wait() // wait here for the goroutine to finish
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
main:  2 1
goroutine:  1 2
```
