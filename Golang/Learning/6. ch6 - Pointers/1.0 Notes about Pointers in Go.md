# Notes about Pointers in Go

- In Go, pointers are variables that hold the memory address of another variable, enabling us to reference and modify data without copying it. 
- Unlike C, Go pointers cannot perform arithmetic, and all pointer values are automatically managed by the garbage collector, eliminating dangling-pointer errors. 
- The language uses compile-time escape analysis to decide whether data lives on the stack or the heap, so taking a pointer does not always force heap allocation. 
  - Go’s compiler performs **escape analysis** to decide if a variable must be heap-allocated when its address “escapes” the function scope; otherwise, it stays on the stack for fast allocation and deallocation.
  - This differs from C where taking a pointer to a stack variable and returning it leads to undefined behavior.
- Go’s `new` and composite-literal `&T{…}` both create pointers, but only `new` zeroes memory before returning the address.
- While different types of variables can take up different numbers of memory locations,
  - every pointer, no matter what type it is pointing to, is always the same number of memory locations.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

type Foo struct {
	A int64
	B float32
}

func main() {
	var i int
	var f float64
	var s Foo

	ptrInt := &i
	ptrFloat := &f
	ptrStruct := &s

	fmt.Printf("Pointer size of *int: %d bytes\n", unsafe.Sizeof(ptrInt))
	fmt.Printf("Pointer size of *float64: %d bytes\n", unsafe.Sizeof(ptrFloat))
	fmt.Printf("Pointer size of *Foo: %d bytes\n", unsafe.Sizeof(ptrStruct))
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
Pointer size of *int: 8 bytes
Pointer size of *float64: 8 bytes
Pointer size of *Foo: 8 bytes
```
