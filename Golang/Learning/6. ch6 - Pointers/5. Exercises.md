1. Create a struct named `Person` with three fields: `FirstName` and `LastName` of type `string` and `Age` of type `int`. Write a function called `MakePerson` that takes in firstName, lastName, and age and returns a Person. Write a second function `MakePersonPointer` that takes in firstName, lastName, and age and returns a *Person. Call both from main. Compile your program with `go build -gcflags="-m"`. This both compiles your code and prints out which values escape to the heap. 

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Person struct {
	FirstName string
	LastName  string
	Age       int
}

// constructs and returns a Person by value
func MakePerson(firstName, lastName string, age int) Person {
	return Person{
		FirstName: firstName,
		LastName:  lastName,
		Age:       age,
	}
}

func MakePersonPointer(firstName, lastName string, age int) *Person {
	// this literal must live beyond the stack frame, so it will escape
	return &Person{
		FirstName: firstName,
		LastName:  lastName,
		Age:       age,
	}
}

func main() {
	p1 := MakePerson("Alice", "Anderson", 30)
	p2 := MakePersonPointer("Bob", "Brown", 40)

    // even though p1 lives in main's frame, its strings themselves
    // pint to the global read-only data. The struct value itself does not escape.
	fmt.Printf("MakePerson returns: %#v (addr=%p)\n", p1, &p1)

	// MakePersonPointer must allocate a Person on the heap
	// so &Person{...} can be returned safely
	fmt.Printf("MakePersonPointer returns: %#v (addr=%p)\n", p2, p2)
}
```

chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
MakePerson returns: main.Person{FirstName:"Alice", LastName:"Anderson", Age:30} (addr=0xc000100090)
MakePersonPointer returns: &main.Person{FirstName:"Bob", LastName:"Brown", Age:40} (addr=0xc0001000c0)
```

- **MakePerson** (by-value) does **not** force any heap allocation.
  
- **MakePersonPointer** returns `*Person`, so the compiler **must** heap‐allocate the struct literal.
  
- **“leaking param: firstName to result”:** We return a field `FirstName` whose value is held in the returned `Person` or `*Person`. 
  - Because that return value outlives the function frame, the compiler can’t keep the parameter on the stack—it “leaks” out.

- **“&Person{…} escapes to heap”:** Taking the address of a composite literal and returning it forces allocation on the heap.
- **“moved to heap: `p1`”:** The local variable `p1` ends up on the heap because it refers to that escaped allocation.
- **Escape analysis**
  - Returning a **pointer** to a local composite literal forces that literal to live on the heap.
  - Returning a **value** allows the compiler to keep it on the stack when safe.

2. Write two functions. The `UpdateSlice` function takes in a `[]string` and a `string`. It sets the last position in the passed-in slice to the passed-in string. At the end of `UpdateSlice`, print the slice after making the change. The `GrowSlice` function also takes in a `[]string` and a `string`. It appends the `string` onto the slice. At the end of `GrowSlice`, print the slice after making the change. Call these functions from `main`. Print out the slice before each function is called and after each function is called. Do you understand why some changes are visible in main and why some changes are not?

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func UpdateSlice(s []string, str string) {
	if len(s) == 0 {
		return
	}

	s[len(s)-1] = str
	fmt.Printf("inside UpdateSlice: %v (addr of arr[0]=%p)\n", s, &s[0])
}

func GrowSlice(s []string, str string) {
	s = append(s, str)
	fmt.Printf("Inside GrowSlice: %v (addr of arr[0]=%p)\n", s, &s[0])
}

func main() {
	base := []string{"x", "y", "z"}
	fmt.Printf("Before UpdateSlice: %v (addr of arr[0]=%p)\n", base, &base[0])
	UpdateSlice(base, "UPDATED")
	fmt.Printf("After UpdateSlice: %v (addr of arr[0]=%p)\n", base, &base[0])

	base2 := []string{"a", "b", "c"}
	fmt.Printf("Before GrowSlice: %v (addr of arr[0]=%p)\n", base2, &base2[0])

	GrowSlice(base2, "GROWN")
	fmt.Printf("After GrowSlice: %v (addr of arr[0]=%p)\n", base2, &base2[0])
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
Before UpdateSlice: [x y z] (addr of arr[0]=0xc000100090)
inside UpdateSlice: [x y UPDATED] (addr of arr[0]=0xc000100090)
After UpdateSlice: [x y UPDATED] (addr of arr[0]=0xc000100090)
Before GrowSlice: [a b c] (addr of arr[0]=0xc0001000c0)
Inside GrowSlice: [a b c GROWN] (addr of arr[0]=0xc0000321e0)
After GrowSlice: [a b c] (addr of arr[0]=0xc0001000c0)
```

- **UpdateSlice** modifies the underlying array in place. 
  - We pass a copy of that header, but both headers point at the same underlying array.
  - `s[len(s)-1] = str` overwrites an element in that shared array.
  - Since we passed in `base`, we see the change in `main`.
- **GrowSlice** does an `append`, which may allocate a new array if capacity isn’t sufficient. 
  - We again get a **copy** of the header.
  - `append(s, str)` must grow a slice of len=3, cap=3 → so it allocates a **new** array, copies “a b c” and adds “GROWN.”
  - That new header (and array) is only stored in the *local* `s` in GrowSlice.
  - Main’s `base2` header still points at the **old** array (len=3, cap=3), so after GrowSlice returns, `base2` is unchanged, and its address is the original one.
- **Slices and mutability**
  - A slice header (`len, cap, ptr`) is passed by value, but it still points at the same underlying array—so **in-place** modifications are visible to the caller.
  - Growing (via `append`) can allocate a brand-new array; unless we capture and return the new slice header, the caller’s slice remains unchanged.

If we want `GrowSlice` to modify the caller's slice, have it return the new slice and do:

```go
func GrowSlice(s []string, str string)[]string{
    return append(s, str)
}

base2 = GrowSlice(base2, "GROWN")
```
