# Using go-cmp to Compare Test Results

- `go-cmp` does the comparison for us and returns a detailed description of what does not match. 
- We can also use `reflect.DeepEqual` to compare structs, maps and slices. 

`cmp/cmp.go`

```go
package cmp

import "time"

type Person struct{
	Name string 
	Age int 
	DateAdded time.Time
}

func CreatePerson(name string, age int) Person{
	return Person{
		Name: name,
		Age: age,
		DateAdded: time.Now(),
	}
}
```

`cmp/cmp_test.go`

- The `cmp.Diff` takes in the expected output and the output that was returned by the function we are testing.
- It returns a string that describes any mismatches between the two inputs.
- If the inputs match, it returns an empty string.

```go
package cmp

import (
	"testing"

	"github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp"
)

// TestCreatePerson demonstrates a simple comparison that will fail.
// Because CreatePerson sets a dynamic DateAdded, it will never match the
// zero-value time.Time in the 'expected' struct.
func TestCreatePerson(t *testing.T){
	expected := Person{
		Name: "Dennis",
		Age: 37,
	}
	result := CreatePerson("Dennis", 37)

	// Use cmp.Diff to find the difference between the two structs.
    // If they are not equal, diff will be a non-empty string.
	if diff := cmp.Diff(expected, result); diff != ""{
		t.Error(diff)
	}
}
```

```sh
cmp ➤ go test
--- FAIL: TestCreatePerson (0.00s)
    cmp_test.go:16:   cmp.Person{
                Name:      "Dennis",
                Age:       37,
        -       DateAdded: s"0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC",
        +       DateAdded: s"2025-06-20 22:09:47.173806943 +0700 +07 m=+0.000601940",
          }

`cmp/cmp_test.go` (Modified)

```go
package cmp

import (
	"testing"

	"github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp"
)


// TestCreatePersonIgnoreDate shows how to ignore a specific field during comparison.
func TestCreatePersonIgnoreDate(t *testing.T){
	expected := Person{
		Name: "Dennis",
		Age: 37, 
	}
	result := CreatePerson("Dennis", 37)

	// Define a custom comparer for the Person type.
    // This function tells cmp.Diff to only consider two Person structs
    // equal if their Name and Age fields match, ignoring DateAdded.
	comparer := cmp.Comparer(func(x, y Person) bool{
		return x.Name == y.Name && x.Age == y.Age	
	})

	// Use cmp.Diff, passing our custom comparer as an option.
    // This diff will be empty because the comparer ignores the DateAdded field.
	if diff := cmp.Diff(expected, result, comparer); diff != ""{
		t.Error(diff)
	}

	// As a separate check, verify that DateAdded was actually populated.
	if result.DateAdded.IsZero(){
		t.Error("DateAdded wasn't assigned")
	}
}
```
