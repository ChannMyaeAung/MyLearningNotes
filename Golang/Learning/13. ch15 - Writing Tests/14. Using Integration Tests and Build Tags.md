# Using Integration Tests and Build Tags

- Even though `httptest` provides a way to avoid testing against external services, we should still write **integration tests**
- Integration tests are automated tests that connect to other services.
- We want to run integration tests only when the support environment is present.
- Integration tests tend to be slower than unit tests, so they are usually run less frequently.
