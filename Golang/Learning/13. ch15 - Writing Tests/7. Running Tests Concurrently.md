# Running Tests Concurrently

- By default, unit tests are run sequentially.
- Since each unit test is supposed to be independent from every other unit test, they make ideal candidates for concurrency.
- To make a unit test run concurrently with other tests, call the `Parallel` method on `*testing.T` as the first line in our test.

```go
func TestMyCode(t *testing.T){
    t.Parallel()
    // rest of test goes here
}
```

- Parallel tests run concurrently with other tests marked as parallel.
- Advantage: it can speed up long-running test suites.
- Disadvantage: 
  - If we have multiple tests that rely on the same shared mutable state, do not mark them as parallel, because we will get inconsistent results.
- The test will panic if we mark it as parallel and use the `Setenv` method in our test function.

## Code Example

`parallel/parallel.go`

```go
package parallel

func toTest(i int) int {
	return i + 10
}
```

`parallel/parallel_test.go`

```go
package parallel

import (
	"fmt"
	"testing"
)


func TestParallelTable(t *testing.T){
	data := []struct{
		name string 
		input int 
		output int 
	}{
		{"a", 10, 20},
		{"b", 30, 40},
		{"c", 50, 60},
	}

	for _, d :=range data{
		d := d
		t.Run(d.name, func(t *testing.T){
			t.Parallel()
			fmt.Println(d.input, d.output)
			out := toTest(d.input)
			if out != d.output{
				t.Error("didn't match", out, d.output)
			}
		})
	}
}
```

```sh
parallel âž¤ go test
10 20
50 60
30 40
PASS
ok      practice/parallel       0.001s
```
