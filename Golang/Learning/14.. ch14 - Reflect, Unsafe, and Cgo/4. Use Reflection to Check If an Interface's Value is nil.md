# Using Reflection to Check if an interface's value is nil

- **Recall**: If a `nil` variable of a concrete type is assigned to a variable of an interface type, the variable of the interface type is not nil.
  - Because a type is associated with the interface variable.
  - An interface value is represented internally as a pair `(type, value)`.
- An interface is considered `nil` only when both its type and its value are unset. 
- To check whether the value associated with an interface is `nil`, we can do so with reflection by using two methods: `IsValid` and `IsNil`.
  - `IsValid` method returns true if `reflect.Value` holds anything other than a `nil` interface.
  - Need to check this first because calling any other method on `reflect.Value` will panic if `IsValid` is false.
  - `IsNil` method returns true if the value of the `reflect.Value` is nil, but it can be called only if the `reflect.Kind` is something that can be nil.
    - If call on a type whose zero value isn't nil, it panics.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
)

// hasNoValue uses reflection to determine if an interface `i` is considered
// to have "no value". This is more comprehensive than a simple `i == nil` check.
func hasNoValue(i interface{}) bool {
	iv := reflect.ValueOf(i)

	// IsValid reports whether v represents a value. It returns false if v is
    // the zero Value. This happens when the interface itself is nil (has no type and no value).
	if !iv.IsValid() {
		return true
	}

	// For certain kinds of types (pointers, slices, maps, functions, and interfaces),
    // we can check if they are nil.
	switch iv.Kind() {
	case reflect.Ptr, reflect.Slice, reflect.Map, reflect.Func, reflect.Interface:
		// IsNil reports whether its argument v is nil.
		return iv.IsNil()
	default:
		// For other types (like int, string, struct), they can't be nil,
        // so they always have a value (even if it's the zero value like 0 or "").
		return false
	}
}

func main() {
    // Case 1: A nil interface.
    // `a` is declared as an interface{} but not assigned a value.
    // It has no type and no value.
	var a interface{}
    
    // `a == nil` is true because the interface itself is nil.
    // `hasNoValue(a)` is true because `reflect.ValueOf(a)` is not valid.
	fmt.Println(a == nil, hasNoValue(a))


    // Case 2: A nil pointer of a concrete type.
    // `b` is a pointer to an int, and its value is nil.
	var b *int
    
    // `b == nil` is true.
    // `hasNoValue(b)` is true because its Kind is Ptr and its value is nil.
	fmt.Println(b == nil, hasNoValue(b))

    // Case 3: An interface holding a nil pointer. This is a common Go gotcha.
    // `c` is an interface that holds the value of `b`.
    // The interface `c` itself is NOT nil. It has a type (*int) and a value (which is nil).
	var c interface{} = b
    
    // `c == nil` is false because the interface has a type component (*int).
    // `hasNoValue(c)` is true because its Kind is Interface, and the value it contains is nil.
	fmt.Println(c == nil, hasNoValue(c))

    // Case 4: A non-nillable type (int).
    // `d` is an int with its zero value, 0.
	var d int
    
    // `hasNoValue(d)` is false because its Kind is Int, which doesn't fall into the switch case.
    // An int cannot be nil.
	fmt.Println(hasNoValue(d))

      // Case 5: An interface holding a non-nillable type.
    // `e` is an interface holding the value of `d` (which is 0).
	var e interface{} = d
    
    // `e == nil` is false because the interface has a type (int) and a value (0).
    // `hasNoValue(e)` is false because the value it contains is a non-nillable int.
	fmt.Println(e == nil, hasNoValue(e))
}
