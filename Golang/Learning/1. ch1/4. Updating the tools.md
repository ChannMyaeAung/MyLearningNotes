# Updating the Go development tools

- Go programs compile to a standalone native binary, so we don't need to worry that updating one development environment could cause currently deployed programs to fail.
- For Mac and Windows, those who installed with `brew` or `cholocatey` can use these tools up update.
- For Linux:
  - Download the latest version
  - Move the old version to a backup directory
  - Unpack the new version, 
  - Delete the old version.

```sh
$ mv /usr/local/go /usr/local/old-go
$ tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ rm -rf /usr/local/old-go
```
