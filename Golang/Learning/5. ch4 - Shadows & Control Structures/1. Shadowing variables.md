# Shadowing Variables

- When we declare a new variable in an inner block with the **same name** as one in an outer block, 
  - the inner declaration **shadows** (hides) the outer one for the remainder of that inner scope.
  - For as long as the shadowing variables exists, we cannot access a shadowed variable.
  - For example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := 10
	if x > 5 {
		fmt.Println(x)
		x := 5
		fmt.Println(x)
		x = x * 5
		fmt.Println(x)
	}
	fmt.Println(x)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
10
5
25
10
```

- Shadowing also occurs with short variable declarations (`:=`) when at least one new variable is introduced;
  - any existing names on the left side are **redeclared** rather than reassigned, creating a new variable bound to that name within the same block.

---

## Shadowing with multiple assignment

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := 10
	if x > 5 {
		x, y := 5, 20
		fmt.Printf("x: %d, y: %d\n", x, y)
	}
	fmt.Println(x)
}
```

- Although there was an existing definition of `x` in an outer block, `x` was still shadowed within the `if` statement.
  - That's because `:=` reuses only variables that are declared in the current block.
  - When using `:=`, we have to make sure that we don't have any variables from an outer scope on the left hand side unless we intend to shadow them.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
x: 5, y: 20
10
```
