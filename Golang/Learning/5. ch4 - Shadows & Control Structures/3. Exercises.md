# Exercises

1. Write a for loop that puts 100 random numbers between 0 and 100 into an int slice .

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// create a properly seeded RNG so that we don't get the same random sequence every run
	r := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))

	nums := make([]int, 100)
	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		nums[i] = r.Intn(101)
	}

	fmt.Println(nums)
}
```

- `rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano())`
  - Calls `time.Now().UnixNano()` to get the current time as an `int64` number of nanoseconds.
  - Passes that as a seed to `rand.NewSource(seed)`, which returns a new pseudorandom‐number **Source** initialized with that seed.
- `rand.New(source)`
  - Wraps the `Source` in a `*rand.Rand` instance.
  - Returns a reproducible generator `r` whose methods (like `r.Intn`) draw from that seeded source, so we get a different sequence each run.

```

2. Loop over the slice you created in exercise 1. For each value in the slice, apply the following rules:
   1. If the value is divisible by 2, print "Two!"
   2. If the value is divisible by 3, print "Three!"
   3. If the value is divisible by 2 and  3, print "Six!". Don't print anything else.
   4. Otherwise, print "Never mind".

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	nums := []int{
		56, 66, 65, 72, 49, 77, 51, 39, 29, 21, 21, 80, 21, 8, 37, 35,
		20, 92, 78, 1, 77, 99, 17, 18, 44, 49, 69, 22, 44, 26, 56, 7,
		19, 74, 84, 9, 9, 100, 58, 80, 75, 16, 67, 36, 10, 42, 23, 44,
		74, 97, 52, 47, 12, 69, 82, 51, 75, 89, 95, 19, 25, 10, 50, 57,
		41, 51, 74, 83, 90, 18, 33, 28, 66, 13, 62, 47, 100, 17, 23, 80,
		99, 81, 28, 43, 42, 85, 17, 44, 51, 35, 75, 61, 54, 45, 100, 1,
		56, 58, 21, 94,
	}

	var out []string

	for _, v := range nums {
		var s string
		switch {
		case v%2 == 0 && v%3 == 0:
			s = "Six!"
		case v%2 == 0:
			s = "Two!"
		case v%3 == 0:
			s = "Three!"
		default:
			s = "Never mind"
		}
		out = append(out, s)
	}

	// if we want to print the comma separated values
	// fmt.Println(strings.Join(out, ", "))
	fmt.Println(out)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
[Two! Six! Never mind Six! Never mind Never mind Three! Three! Never mind Three! Three! Two! Three! Two! Never mind Never mind Two! Two! Six! Never mind Never mind Three! Never mind Six! Two! Never mind Three! Two! Two! Two! Two! Never mind Never mind Two! Six! Three! Three! Two! Two! Two! Three! Two! Never mind Six! Two! Six! Never mind Two! Two! Never mind Two! Never mind Six! Three! Two! Three! Three! Never mind Never mind Never mind Never mind Two! Two! Three! Never mind Three! Two! Never mind Six! Six! Three! Two! Six! Never mind Two! Never mind Two! Never mind Never mind Two! Three! Three! Two! Never mind Six! Never mind Never mind Two! Three! Never mind Three! Never mind Six! Three! Two! Never mind Two! Two! Three! Two!]

3. Start a new program. In main, declare an `int` variable called `total`. Write a `for` loop that uses a variable named `i` to iterate from 0 (inclusive) to 10 (exclusive). The body of the `for` loop should be as follows:

   ```go
   total := total + i
   fmt.Println(total)
   ```

   After the `for` loop, print out the value of `total`. What is printed out? What is the likely bug in this code?

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var total int
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		total := total + i
		fmt.Println(total)
	}
	fmt.Println("Total:", total)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
Total: 0
```

- The problem is variable shadowing.
- Inside the loop we wrote `total := total + i` 
  - which declares a new `total` scoped to the `for` block (initialized from the outer `total`), so the outer `total` never changes and remains 0.
- To fix it, we can use assignment instead of declaration:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var total int
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		total = total + i
		fmt.Println(total)
	}
	fmt.Println("Total:", total)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build 
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
0
1
3
6
10
15
21
28
36
45
Total: 45
```
