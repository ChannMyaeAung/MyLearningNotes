# Introduction

- Go has type abstraction, allowing us to write code that invokes methods without explicitly specifying the implementation.
- Go is designed to encourage the best practices, avoiding inheritance while encouraging composition.
- An abstract type is one that specifies what a type should do but not how it is done.
- A concrete type specifies what and how. 
  - This means that the type has a specified way to store its data and provides an implementation of any methods declared on the type.

## Types in Go

- We can define our own types based on existing ones using the `type` keyword. 
  - This is crucial for attaching methods.
- When we define a new type, it becomes a **distinct type** from the underlying type, even if they have the same structure. 
  - Allows us to define methods specifically for our new type and enforce type safety.

```go
type Person struct{
    FirstName string
    Lastname string
    Age int
}
```

- Should be read as a user-defined type with the name `Person` to have the underlying type of the struct literal that follows.
- In addition to struct literals, we can use any primitive type or compound type literal to define a concrete type.

```go
type Score int
type Converter func(string)Score
type TeamScores map[string]Score
```



### Code Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	type Celsius float64
	type Fahrenheit float64
	type MyInt int

	var c Celsius = 25.0
	var f Fahrenheit = 77.0

	// c = f // Error: cannot use f(type Fahrenheit) as type Celsius
	c = Celsius(f) // Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius (explicit conversion)
	fmt.Printf("Celsius: %v, Fahrenheit: %v\n", c, f)

	var i MyInt = 44
	fmt.Println("MyInt:", i)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
Celsius: 77, Fahrenheit: 77
MyInt: 44
```
