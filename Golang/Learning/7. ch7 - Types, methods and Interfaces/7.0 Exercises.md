1. You've been asked to manage a basketball league and are going to write a program to help you. Define two types. The first one, called `Team`, has a field for the name of the team and a field for the player names. The second type is called `League` and has a field called `Teams` for the teams in the league and a field called `Wins` that maps a team's name to its number of wins.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Team struct {
	Name    string
	Players []string
}

type League struct {
	Teams []Team
	Wins  map[string]int
}

func main() {
	// testing
	t1 := Team{
		Name:    "Team A",
		Players: []string{"Player 1", "Player 2"},
	}

	t2 := Team{
		Name:    "Team B",
		Players: []string{"Player 3", "Player 4"},
	}

	league := League{
		Teams: []Team{t1, t2},
		Wins: map[string]int{
			"Team A": 0,
			"Team B": 0,
		},
	}

	// simulate a game: team b wins
	league.Wins["Team B"]++

	// Print league standings
	for _, team := range league.Teams {
		fmt.Printf("%s: %d wins\n", team.Name, league.Wins[team.Name])
	}
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Team A: 0 wins
Team B: 1 wins
```

2.  Add two methods to `League`. The first method is called `matchResult`. It takes 4 parameters: the name of the first team, its score in the game, the name of the second team, and its score in the game. This method should update `Wins` field in League. Add a second method to `League` called `Ranking` that returns a slice of the team names in order of wins. Build your data structures and call these methods from the main function in your program using some sample data.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

type Team struct {
	Name    string
	Players []string
}

type League struct {
	Teams []Team
	Wins  map[string]int
}

// updates Wins based on the match outcome.
func (l *League) matchResult(team1 string, score1 int, team2 string, score2 int) {
	// increment win count for the team with the higher score
	if score1 > score2 {
		l.Wins[team1]++
	} else if score2 > score1 {
		l.Wins[team2]++
	}
}

// ranking returns a slice of team names sorted by descending wins.
func (l *League) Ranking() []string {
	// collect team names
	names := make([]string, len(l.Teams))
	for i, t := range l.Teams {
		names[i] = t.Name
	}

	// sort teams by wins in descending order
	sort.Slice(names, func(i, j int) bool {
		return l.Wins[names[i]] > l.Wins[names[j]]
	})

	return names
}

func main() {
	t1 := Team{Name: "Raptors", Players: []string{"Chan", "Pascal", "Fred"}}
	t2 := Team{Name: "Lakers", Players: []string{"LeBron", "Anthony", "Russell"}}
	t3 := Team{Name: "Bucks", Players: []string{"Giannis", "Khris", "Jrue"}}

	// initialize league with zeroed win counts
	league := League{
		Teams: []Team{t1, t2, t3},
		Wins: map[string]int{
			t1.Name: 0,
			t2.Name: 0,
			t3.Name: 0,
		},
	}

	// record some match results
	league.matchResult("Raptors", 100, "Lakers", 98)
	league.matchResult("Lakers", 110, "Bucks", 115)
	league.matchResult("Raptors", 90, "Bucks", 85)

	// print current wins
	fmt.Println("Current Wins:")
	for _, team := range league.Teams {
		fmt.Printf("%s: %d wins\n", team.Name, league.Wins[team.Name])
	}

	// print ranking
	fmt.Println("\nRanking:")
	for i, name := range league.Ranking() {
		fmt.Printf("%d. %s (%d wins)\n", i+1, name, league.Wins[name])
	}
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Current Wins:
Raptors: 2 wins
Lakers: 0 wins
Bucks: 1 wins

Ranking:
1. Raptors (2 wins)
2. Bucks (1 wins)
3. Lakers (0 wins)
```

3.  Define an interface called `Ranker` that has a single method called `Ranking` that returns a slice of strings. Write a function called `RankPrinter` with two parameters, the first of type `Ranker` and the second of type `io.Writer`. Use the `io.WriteString` function to write the values returned by `Ranker` to the `io.Writer`, with a newline separating each result. Call this function from main.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"os"
	"sort"
)

type Team struct {
	Name    string
	Players []string
}

type League struct {
	Teams []Team
	Wins  map[string]int
}

// updates Wins based on the match outcome.
func (l *League) matchResult(team1 string, score1 int, team2 string, score2 int) {
	// increment win count for the team with the higher score
	if score1 > score2 {
		l.Wins[team1]++
	} else if score2 > score1 {
		l.Wins[team2]++
	}
}

// ranking returns a slice of team names sorted by descending wins.
func (l *League) Ranking() []string {
	names := make([]string, len(l.Teams))
	for i, t := range l.Teams {
		names[i] = t.Name
	}
	sort.Slice(names, func(i, j int) bool {
		return l.Wins[names[i]] > l.Wins[names[j]]
	})
	return names
}

// Ranker defines anything that can produce a ranking of names
type Ranker interface {
	Ranking() []string
}

// RankPrinter writes each ranked name to the writer, one per line
func RankPrinter(r Ranker, w io.Writer) {
	for _, name := range r.Ranking() {
		io.WriteString(w, name+"\n")
	}
}

func main() {
	t1 := Team{Name: "Raptors", Players: []string{"Chan", "Pascal", "Fred"}}
	t2 := Team{Name: "Lakers", Players: []string{"LeBron", "Anthony", "Russell"}}
	t3 := Team{Name: "Bucks", Players: []string{"Giannis", "Khris", "Jrue"}}

	league := League{
		Teams: []Team{t1, t2, t3},
		Wins: map[string]int{
			t1.Name: 0,
			t2.Name: 0,
			t3.Name: 0,
		},
	}

	// record some match results
	league.matchResult("Raptors", 100, "Lakers", 98)
	league.matchResult("Lakers", 110, "Bucks", 115)
	league.matchResult("Raptors", 90, "Bucks", 85)

	fmt.Println("Current Wins:")
	for _, team := range league.Teams {
		fmt.Printf("%s: %d wins\n", team.Name, league.Wins[team.Name])
	}

	// Print ranking via RankPrinter
	fmt.Println("\nLeague Ranking:")
	RankPrinter(&league, os.Stdout)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ make
go fmt ./...
practice.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/practice$ ./practice
Current Wins:
Raptors: 2 wins
Lakers: 0 wins
Bucks: 1 wins

League Ranking:
Raptors
Bucks
Lakers
```
