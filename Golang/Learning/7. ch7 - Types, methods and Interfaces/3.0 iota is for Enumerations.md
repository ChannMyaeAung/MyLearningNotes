# iota is for Enumerations Sometimes

- Go doesn't have enumeration type. Instead, it has `iota`, which lets us assign an increasing value to a set of constants.
- When using `iota`, the best practice is to first define a type based on `int` that will represent all the valid values.

## Example #1

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type MailCategory int

// next use a const block to define a set of values for our type
const (
	Uncategorized MailCategory = iota
	Personal
	Spam
	Social
	Advertisements
)

func main() {
	// Print the value of the constant
	fmt.Println(Uncategorized)  // 0
	fmt.Println(Personal)       // 1
	fmt.Println(Spam)           // 2
	fmt.Println(Social)         // 3
	fmt.Println(Advertisements) // 4

	// Print the type of the constant
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", Uncategorized)  
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", Personal)       
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", Spam)           
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", Social)         
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", Advertisements) 
}
```

- The first constant in the `const` block has the type specified and its value is set to `iota`.
- Every subsequent line has neither the type nor a value assigned to it.
- When the Go compiler sees that, it repeats the type and assignment to all the subsequent constants in the block which is `iota`.
- The value of `iota` increases with each constant defined in the const block, starting with 0.
- When a new const block is created, `iota` is set back to 0.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
0
1
2
3
4
main.MailCategory
main.MailCategory
main.MailCategory
main.MailCategory
main.MailCategory
```

## Example #2

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
	Field1 = 0
	Field2 = 1 + iota
	Field3 = 20
	Field4
	Field5 = iota
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Field1: %d, Field2: %d, Field3: %d, Field4: %d, Field5: %d\n", Field1, Field2, Field3, Field4, Field5)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
Field1: 0, Field2: 2, Field3: 20, Field4: 20, Field5: 4
```

- `Field2` is assigned to 2 because `iota` has a value of 1 on the second line in the `const` block.
- `Field4` is 20 because it has no type or value explicitly assigned, so it gets the value of the previous line with a type and assignment.
- `Field5` is 4 because it is the fifth line and `iota` starts counting from 0.

> **Important Note:** "Don't use iota for defining constants where its values are explicitly defined (elsewhere). For example, when implementing parts of a specification and the specification says which values are assigned to which constants, you should explicitly write the constant values. Use `iota` for internal purposes only. That is, where the constants are referred to by name rather than value. That way you can optimally enjoy `iota` by inserting new constants at any moment in time/location in the list without the risk of breaking everything." Danny van Heumen

## Example Code #3

- Because we can assign a literal expression to a constant, we should use `iota` for cases like this.
- `iota` starts numbering from 0, thus a common pattern is assign the first `iota` value in the const block to _ or a constant that indicates the value is invalid.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type BitField int

const (
	Field1 BitField = 1 << iota // assigned 1
	Field2 // 2
	Field3 // 4
	Field4 // 8
	Field5 // 16
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Field1: %d, Field2: %d, Field3: %d, Field4: %d, Field5: %d\n", Field1, Field2, Field3, Field4, Field5)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
Field1: 1, Field2: 2, Field3: 4, Field4: 8, Field5: 16
```
