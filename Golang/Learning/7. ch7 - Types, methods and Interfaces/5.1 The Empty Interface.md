# The Empty Interface (`interface{}`)

- An interface with no methods is called the empty interface, written as `interface{}`. 
- Since any type has zero or more methods, **any type satisfies the empty interface**. 
  - This means a variable of type `interface{}` can hold a value of absolutely any type.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func PrintAnything(val interface{}){
	fmt.Printf("Value: %v, Type: %T\n", val, val)
}

type Dog struct {
	Name string
}

func main() {
	PrintAnything(10)
	PrintAnything("Hello, World!")
	PrintAnything(Dog{Name: "Rex"})
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
Value: 10, Type: int
Value: Hello, World!, Type: string
Value: {Rex}, Type: main.Dog
```

- While powerful, using `interface{}` loses type safety at compile time.
- Often need to use **type assertions** or **type switches** to determine the underlying concrete type and work with it safely.
