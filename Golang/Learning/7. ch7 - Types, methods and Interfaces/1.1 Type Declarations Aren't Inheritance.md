# Type Declarations Aren't Inheritance

- In addition to declaring types based on built-in Go types and struct literals, we can also declare a user-defined type based on another user-defined type.

```go
type HighScore Score 
type Employee Person 
```

- In a language with inheritance, a child instance can be used anywhere the parent instance is used.
  - The child instance also has all the methods and data structures of the parent instance. 
- That's not the case in Go. We can't assign an instance of type `HighScore` to a variable of type `Score`, or vice versa 
  - without a type conversion, nor can you assign either of them to a variable of type `int` without a type conversion. 
  - Any methods defined on `Score` aren't defined on `HighScore`

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Score int
type HighScore Score

type Person struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
}
type Employee Person

func main() {
	var i int = 300
	var s Score = 100
	var hs HighScore = 200

	// hs = s // compilation error
	// s = i // compilation error
	s = Score(i)
	hs = HighScore(s)

	fmt.Printf("Score: %d, Type: %T\n", s, s)
	fmt.Printf("HighScore: %d, Type: %T\n", hs, hs)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
Score: 300, Type: main.Score
HighScore: 300, Type: main.HighScore
```
