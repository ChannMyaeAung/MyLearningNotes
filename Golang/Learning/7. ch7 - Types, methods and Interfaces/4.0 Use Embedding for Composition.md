# Use Embedding for Composition

- While Go doesn't have inheritance, it encourages code reuse via built-in support for composition and promotion.
- In the following code, `Manager` contains a field o type `Employee`, but no name is assigned to that field. 
  - This makes `Employee` an embedded field.
- Any fields (Name, ID in this case) and methods (Description in this case) declared on an embedded field are promoted to the containing struct (`Manger` in this case) 
  - and can be invoked directly on it.
  - In this case, `m.ID` and `m.Description()`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Employee struct {
	Name string
	ID   string
}

func (e Employee) Description() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%s (%s)", e.Name, e.ID)
}

type Manager struct {
	Employee
	Reports []Employee
}

func (m Manager) FindNewEmployee() []Employee {
	return m.Reports
}

func main() {
	m := Manager{
		Employee: Employee{
			Name: "Chan Myae Aung",
			ID:   "123456",
		},
		Reports: []Employee{},
	}
	fmt.Println(m.ID)
	fmt.Println(m.Description())
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
123456
Chan Myae Aung (123456)
```

- We can embed any type within a struct, not just another struct. 
  - This promotes the methods on the embedded type to the containing struct.
- If the containing struct has fields or methods with the same as an embedded field,
  - we need to use the embedded field's type to refer to the obscured fields or methods.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Inner struct {
	X int
}

type Outer struct {
	Inner
	X int
}

func main() {
	o := Outer{
		Inner: Inner{
			X: 10,
		},
		X: 20,
	}
	fmt.Println("Outer.X:", o.X)
    
    // we can access the X on Inner only by specifying Inner explicitly
	fmt.Println("Outer.Inner.X:", o.Inner.X)
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ make
go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
Outer.X: 20
Outer.Inner.X: 10
```
