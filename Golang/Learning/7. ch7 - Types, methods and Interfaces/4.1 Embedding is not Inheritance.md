# Embedding is Not Inheritance

- We cannot assign the variable of type `Manager` to a variable of type `Employee`
- If we want to access the `Employee` field in `Manager`, we must do so explicitly.

```go
var eFail Employee = m // compilation error!
var eOK Employee = m.Employee // ok
```

---

- Go has no dynamic dispatch for concrete types.
- The methods on the embedded field have no idea they are embedded.
- If we have a method on an embedded field that calls another method on the embedded field, 
  - and the containing struct has a method for the same name,
  - the method on the embedded field is invoked.
  - Not the method on the containing struct.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Inner struct {
	A int
}


// we return strings because the goal was to produce a labeled, human-readable msg
// this func takes an int, uses fmt.Sprintf to turn it into a string and returns that
func (i Inner) IntPrinter(val int) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("Inner: %d", val)
}

func (i Inner) Double() string {
	return i.IntPrinter(i.A * 2)
}

type Outer struct {
	Inner
	S string
}

func (o Outer) IntPrinter(val int) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("Outer: %d", val)
}

func main() {
	o := Outer{
		Inner: Inner{
			A: 10,
		},
		S: "Hello",
	}
	fmt.Println(o.Double())
}
```

go fmt ./...
hello.go
go vet ./...
go build
chan@CMA:~/Go_Programming/ch1$ ./hello_world
Inner: 20
