# Accept Interfaces, Return Structs

- Functions should accept interfaces.
  - They make the code more flexible and explicitly declare the exact functionality being used.
- The primary reasons our functions should return concrete types is they make it easier to gradually update a function's return values in new versions of our code.
- When a concrete type is returned by a function, new methods and fields can be added without breaking existing code that calls the function,
  - because the new fields and methods are ignored. 
- The same is not true for an interface.
  - Adding a new method to an interface means that all existing implementations of that interface must be updated or the code breaks.
  - This is the difference between a minor release that is backward compatible and a major release, which is backward breaking.

## Code Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// the interface our functions accept
type Worker interface {
	DoWork(string) string
}

// concrete type we return
type workerImpl struct {
	prefix string
}

// NewWorker returns a concrete *workerImpl
func NewWorker(pfx string) *workerImpl {
	return &workerImpl{prefix: pfx}
}

// DoWork implements Worker
func (w *workerImpl) DoWork(s string) string {
	return w.prefix + s
}

// process accepts the Worker interface
func Process(w Worker, data string) string {
	return w.DoWork(data)
}

func main() {
	// caller uses Process with any Worker
	w := NewWorker(">> ")
	fmt.Println(Process(w, "task"))

	// Concrete methods can be extended freely
	// w.ExtraInfo() would work if defined, without breaking above.
}
```
