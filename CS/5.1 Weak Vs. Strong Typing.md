# Strong vs. Weak Typing

- **Strong typing**: A language enforces strict type rules, disallowing operations on mismatched types without an explicit conversion and preventing memory-unsafe reinterpretations.

- **Weak typing**: A language permits implicit conversions or arbitrary reinterpretations of data (e.g., pointer casts in C), potentially leading to unpredictable behavior or memory violations. 

## Why JavaScript Is Dynamic yet Strong

- JavaScript determines the type of each value when the code runs, so variable declarations like `let x = 5;` and later `x = "hello";` are valid, demonstrating dynamic typing.
- However, JavaScript enforces type safety in many operations and will throw errors when operations violate a value’s type constraints.
  - Attempting to call a non-function value as a function, for example, results in a runtime `TypeError` rather than silent misbehavior.

## Why C Is Static yet Weak

- C’s compiler assigns and checks the types of all variables, function parameters, and expressions before generating machine code, illustrating static typing.
- Developers must declare variable types explicitly, and the compiler enforces type constraints during the build process.
- Nonetheless, C allows explicit casts between unrelated pointer types and to/from `void*`,  from `int` to `float` or between pointer types and permits unchecked casts like `(char*)p` where `p` is an `int*`, effectively bypassing the compiler’s type system and enabling raw memory reinterpretation.
- These practices, along with the absence of runtime type checks, categorize C as weakly typed.
  - The language trusts the programmer’s intent over enforcing strict type safety, and many type errors only surface when they cause memory corruption or undefined behavior.
