# Static vs Dynamic Typing

- Static typing and dynamic typing represent two fundamental approaches to how programming languages associate and check data types. 
- In **statically typed languages**:
  - The types of variables are determined and checked at compile time, leading to earlier error detection and potentially better performance, at the cost of reduced flexibility and more verbose code.
  - Types may be declared explicitly by the developer or inferred by the compiler, but once set, a variableâ€™s type cannot change during execution.
  - **Advantages:** Early error detection, enhanced IDE support, better performance through compile-time optimizations.
  - **Disadvantages:** More verbose, longer compile times, steeper learning curve for type systems.
  - **Example Langs:** C, C++, Java, Go, Rust, TypeScript. 
- In **dynamically typed languages**:
  - Type information is associated with values rather than variables and is checked at runtime, offering greater flexibility and faster prototyping but shifting error detection to execution time and sometimes impacting reliability. 
  - This means the same variable can hold values of different types in different parts of the program, until a type error is encountered during execution.
  - **Advantages:** Concise code, rapid prototyping, high flexibility, good for scripting and small projects.
  - **Disadvantages:** Errors at runtime, harder to refactor large codebases, less tooling support for catching mistakes.
  - **Example Langs:** Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, Lua.

## Use Cases and Considerations

- **Large-Scale Systems**: Static typing shines in large codebases where maintainability, reliability, and performance are critical.
- **Rapid Prototyping & Scripting**: Dynamic typing accelerates development cycles, making it a popular choice for web scripting, automation, and data analysis tasks.
- **Team Expertise**: Teams experienced with type systems may prefer static typing, while teams valuing speed and minimal boilerplate may lean toward dynamic typing.
