## ASCII

ASCII stands for "American Standard Code for Information Interchange". It is a way of representing characters (letters, numbers, and symbols) as numbers.

Each character has a unique number assigned to it in the ASCII table. For example:

- The letter 'A' has the ASCII value of 65
- The number '5' has the ASCII value of 53
- The symbol '!' has the ASCII value of 33

The ASCII table goes from 0 to 127, covering the most common characters used in English and some basic symbols.

In a computer, characters are stored and manipulated using these ASCII values. When you type a letter on your keyboard, the computer is actually detecting the corresponding ASCII value and using that to represent the character.

This allows computers to work with and process text data, as they can store and manipulate the numeric ASCII values instead of the actual characters. It's a fundamental way that computers handle textual information.

So, in simple terms, ASCII is just a way to assign a unique number to each character, so that computers can understand and work with them. It's a standardized system that allows different computer systems to communicate and process text data in a consistent way.
