# Memory Addressing Modes

- Assembly language contains multiple **addressing modes**
- An addressing mode is essentially the way that the CPU finds a value for an instruction.

### Immediate Addressing

- The operand is directly encoded in the instruction itself.

- Example:

  ```assembly
  movq $5, %rax  # $ indicates that it should use immediate mode
  # That is the value is contained within the instruction itself.
  ```

- **Usage:** Quick constant values; no memory lookup is required.

### Register Addressing

- The operand is stored in a register.
- Example: In `movq $5, %rax`, the %rax is a register.
- **Usage:** Fastest access, as it avoids memory operations.

### Direct (Absolute) Addressing

- The instruction specifies the exact memory address where the operand resides.

- Example:

  ```assembly
  movq first_value, %rbx # first_value is a direct memory address
  ```

### Indirect Addressing

- The memory address of the operand is held in a register.

- Example: say %rbx held a memory address

  ```assembly
  movq (%rbx), %rax  ; Load the value pointed to by %rbx into %rax
  ```

- If %rbx contains an invalid memory address, we'll either wind up with junk in %rax or if the memory location doesn't exist at all, it will cause an error and the program will abort.

- **Usage:** Allows flexible access to data structures like arrays and pointers.
