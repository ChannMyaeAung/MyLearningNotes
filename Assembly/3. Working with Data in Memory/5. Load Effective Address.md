# Load Effective Address (`leaq`)

- Computes a memory address from a given addressing mode (using base, index, scale, and displacement) and loads that computed address into a register.
- It does **not** access or load the memory content; it only calculates the address.
- Commonly used for pointer arithmetic or simple arithmetic operations without affecting flags.

```assembly
leaq (%rax, %rcx, 8), %rdx  # Computes %rax + %rcx*8 and stores the result in %rdx
```
