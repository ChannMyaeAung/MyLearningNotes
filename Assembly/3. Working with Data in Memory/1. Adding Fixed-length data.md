# Adding Fixed-Length Data Sections to Programs

```assembly
.globl _start
.section .data
first_value:
    .quad 4
second_value:
    .quad 6
final_result:
    .quad 0

.section .text

_start:
    # load values into registers
    movq first_value, %rbx
    movq second_value, %rcx

    # Perform the computation
    addq %rbx, %rcx

    # Store the results into memory
    movq %rcx, final_result

    # return the value to the OS
    movq $60, %rax
    movq final_result, %rdi
    syscall
```

- `.section .data`: We tell the assembler that we are in data section.
  - What it does is bookmark that location in memory.
- `.quad 4` means that the assembler will allocate a single quadword and store the value 4 there.
  - It will store them each as a separate quadword sequentially in memory.
- `movq first_value, %rbx`: tells the assembler to move the data from the location specified by the address that `first_value` refers to and store it in %rbx.
- There is no $ sign in front of `first_value` because `first_value` doesn't refer to the value 6 itself, but to the address of the memory where `first_value` is stored.

## Shorter Version

```assembly
.globl _start
.section .data
first_value:
    .quad 4
second_value:
    .quad 6


.section .text

_start:
    # load values into registers
    movq first_value, %rdi

    # Perform the computation
    addq second_value, %rdi

    # return the value to the OS
    movq $60, %rax
    syscall
```

- Rather than loading the second addition operand to a register, we just accessed the memory directly and added it to %rdi which also stored the result in %rdi.
