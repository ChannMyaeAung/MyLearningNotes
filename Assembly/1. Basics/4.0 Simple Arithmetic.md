# Simple Arithmetic

- On x86-64, arithmetic instructions only have two operands. (still considered "source" and "destination").
- The 2nd operand has two functions:
  - operates as both part of the arithmetic and is also the destination wherer the result is stored.

```assembly
addq %rax, %rdi
```

- What this does is take the value in %rax, add it to the value in %rdi, and store the resulting value in %rdi, erasing whatever was there before.
- `addq`:Adds the src and dest together.
- `subq`: Substracts the src from the dest.
- `incq`: increments (adds one to) the dest.
- `decq`: Decrements (subtracts one from) the dest.

- `mulq`: Multiplies the src by `%rax. %rax` is the dest. A number cannot be used as the src. (Must be a register or memory location).
- `divq`: Divides %rax by the src . %rax is the dest. (Same principle applies as `mulq`).
  - The remainder is store din another register, %rdx, which should be set to zero before the instruction occurs.
