# Building a Simple Assembly Language Program

```assembly
# My first program. This is a comment.
.globl _start
.section .text
_start:
    movq $60, %rax
    movq $3, %rdi 
    syscall
```

- Anything starts with a dot (.) is an instruction to the assembler (aka a directive) and doesn't usually generate code on its own.
- Normally, all of our own names for things get discarded by the assembler.
  - `.globl` directive tells the assembler not to do this.

- `.section` directive tells the assembler that the next part of the listing should be placed in the code section of the program.
- `_start`: entry point of the program
- We can freely switch between .data and .text sections.
- `movq`: move quadword (64-bit).
  - 1st is the "source" and 2nd is the "destination" separated by a comma.
- `movq $60, %rax`: Moves the value 60 into the register named %rax which is a 64-bit register. The dollar sign means we are treating 60 as a value not an address or anything else.
  - 60: the exit system call.
- In the exit system call, the %rdi register holds the exit status of the program.
- `syscall` instruction does not care in what order the registers were set.
  - Only matters what the values are at the time that the `syscall` instruction is issued.


```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as myexit.s -o myexit.o
myexit.s: Assembler messages:
myexit.s: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld myexit.o -o myexit
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./myexit
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
3
```

- `as myexit.s -o myexit.o`:  This takes the source code, converts it to machine code and places it in an object file `myexit.o`.
- `ld myexit.o -o myexit`: This will produce the executable file.
