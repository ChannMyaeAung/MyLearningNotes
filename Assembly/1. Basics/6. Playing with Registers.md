# Playing with the Registers

```assembly
.section .text       # Define the text section, which contains the executable instructions
.globl _start        # Declare _start as a global symbol, which is the entry point of the program
_start:
    movw $0b0000000100000010, %bx  # Move the 16-bit binary value 0b0000000100000010 into the %bx register
    addb %bh, %bl                  # Add the high byte (%bh) to the low byte (%bl) of %bx
                                   # %bh = 0b00000001, %bl = 0b00000010
                                   # %bl = %bl + %bh = 0b00000010 + 0b00000001 = 0b00000011 (3 in decimal)
    movb $0, %bh                   # Zero out the high byte (%bh) of %bx

    movq %rbx, %rdi                # Move the value in %rbx (which is now 3) into %rdi

    movq $60, %rax                 # Move the system call number 60 (sys_exit) into %rax
    syscall                        # Execute the system call to exit the program with the exit status in %rdi
```

**Note:**

- `%bx` register can be accessed by individual bytes - %bh and %bl.
- Thus, the high 8 bytes 00000001 (1 in decimal) and the low 8 bits is 00000010 (2 in decimal).
- These two values are added together and then stored in %bl.
- `movb $0, %bh` - cleared out the high byte of %bx and then 
- moved the whole of %rbx into %rdi to be the status code.
