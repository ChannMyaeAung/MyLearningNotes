# Assembly instructions

- Assembly programs consist of instructions (mnemonics) that correspond directly to machine operations.
- `MOV` – Transfer data between registers or between memory and registers.
- `ADD`, `SUB` – Perform arithmetic operations.
- `JMP`, `JE`, `JNE` – Control flow instructions (jumps and branches).
- `CMP` – Compare two values.

## Registers

- Registers are small, fast storage locations within the CPU. 

- In x86-64 assembly, common registers include:

  - General-purpose registers: `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, `rdx`, etc.

  - Special registers like the instruction pointer (`rip`) and stack pointer (`rsp`).

## Memory

- Assembly interacts with memory directly through addresses. 
- We can load data from memory into registers and store register values back into memory.

---

## Addressing Modes

- Immediate addressing (using a constant).
- Register addressing (using the value in a register).
- Memory addressing (using a memory location, often computed via registers and offsets).

**Labels and Directives:**
 Labels serve as targets for jumps and branches, while assembler directives (like `section`, `global`, etc.) help organize code and data.

**Directives:** 

- **`.data`:** Defines a section for initialized data.
- **`.bss`:** Allocates space for uninitialized data.
- **`.text`:** Contains the actual code (instructions).
