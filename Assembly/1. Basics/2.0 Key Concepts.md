# Assembly instructions

- Assembly programs consist of instructions (mnemonics) that correspond directly to machine operations.
- `MOV` – Transfer data between registers or between memory and registers.

  - `movq` - q suffix refers to quadwords.

- In the GNU Assembler, 

  - `q` suffix on instructions to indicate quadwords.
  - `l` - double-words (longs)
  - `w` - words
  - `b` - individual bytes.

  ```assembly
  movb $5, %ah # move a single byte into the %ah register
  
  movw %ax, %dx # move the %ax register into the %dx register
  ```
  
- `ADD`, `SUB` – Perform arithmetic operations.
- `JMP`, `JE`, `JNE` – Control flow instructions (jumps and branches).
- `CMP` – Compare two values.

## Registers

- Registers are small, fast storage locations within the CPU. 

- In x86-64 assembly, common registers include:

  - General-purpose registers: `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, `rdx`, etc.
    - `rax` (Accumulator Register):
      - Often used for arithmetic operations.
  
      - Can serve as implicit operand
  
    - `rbx` (base register):
      - To hold pointers or base addresses for data structures.
      - Often used for indexed addressing. 
      - It is a nonvolatile (callee‑saved) register in many calling conventions. 
        - This means that if a function uses RBX, it must restore its original value before returning.
  
    - `rcx` (counter register):
      - Historically used for counts when doing repetitive code.
  
    - `rdx` (data register):
      - Often used in arithmetic operations, especially in multiplication and division 
  
      - Division instructions use RDX to hold the remainder).
  
      - Like RCX, RDX is volatile and can be overwritten by called functions.
  
    - `rdi` (First Argument Register): 
      - The first argument to a function is passed in `rdi`.
      - comes from "destination index".
  
    - `rsi` (second argument register):
      - The second argument in the calling convention is passed in `rsi`.
  
      - Works in tandem with `rdi` to handle the first two function params efficiently.
  
    - `rdx`(Third Argument Register):
      - Third argument is passed in `rdx`.
  
      - Also used in certain arithmetic and I/O operations.
  
    - `rbp` (base pointer): 
      - Serves as a stable reference point for a function's stack frame.
  
      - At the start of a function, the current value of the stack pointer (`%rsp`) is typically saved into `%rbp` (after pushing the old `%rbp` onto the stack), so that even though `%rsp` may change (for example, when local variables are allocated or values are pushed/popped), `%rbp` remains fixed throughout the function. 
  
      - This lets the function access its local variables and the function’s arguments (which reside at fixed offsets relative to `%rbp`) in a straightforward way. 
  
      - It is a callee‑saved register, meaning that if a function uses `%rbp`, it must restore its original value before returning.
  
  - Special registers like the instruction pointer (`rip`) and stack pointer (`rsp`).
- Originally the accumulator was called %ax and held 16 bits.
- When the arch was extended to 32-bit, %ax was called %eax (extended %ax).
- Upon becoming 64-bit, becomes %rax.
- Hence, %rax contains all 64 bits of the register, %eax simply the least significant 32 bits of the %rax register, and %ax refers to the least significant 16 bits of the %rax register. (%ah - 8 bits, %al - 8 bits)
- Bit 0 is the least significant bit and bit 64 is the most significant bit.
- In binary 1011001101111, the digits to the left are the most significant and the digits to the right are the least significant.



In x86-64 (AMD64) architecture, the 64-bit extension added eight extra registers named R8 through R15.

- These registers were introduced with the x86-64 extension. 
- They increase the number of available general-purpose registers, allowing for more efficient code generation and better performance, particularly in function calls and complex computations.
- R8 is a full 64-bit register that can store large integers or memory addresses.
- **Accessing Parts of R8:**
  Similar to the traditional registers, we can access different portions of R8:
  - **R8D:** The lower 32 bits of R8.
  - **R8W:** The lower 16 bits of R8.
  - **R8B:** The lower 8 bits of R8.
- This flexibility lets us perform operations on different data sizes without affecting the entire 64-bit content.

## Memory

- Assembly interacts with memory directly through addresses. 
- We can load data from memory into registers and store register values back into memory.

---

## Addressing Modes

- Immediate addressing (using a constant).
- Register addressing (using the value in a register).
- Memory addressing (using a memory location, often computed via registers and offsets).

---

**Labels and Directives:**
 Labels serve as targets for jumps and branches, while assembler directives (like `section`, `global`, etc.) help organize code and data.

**Directives:** 

- **`.data`:** Defines a section for initialized data.
- **`.bss`:** Allocates space for uninitialized data.
- **`.text`:** Contains the actual code (instructions).
