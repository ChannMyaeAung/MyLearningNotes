# Direction Flag (DF) & Zero Flag (ZF)

- Both flags are part of the CPU’s `%eflags` register and play crucial roles in controlling how instructions execute and how branching decisions are made in assembly programs.

## Direction Flag (DF)

- Used by string operations (e.g., MOVS, LODS, STOS, CMPS, SCAS) to determine whether they process data from lower addresses to higher addresses (incrementing) or vice versa (decrementing).

- **DF = 0:** String instructions auto-increment the pointer registers (e.g., `%rsi`, `%rdi`) after each operation. This is the default mode for processing arrays from beginning to end.
- **DF = 1:** String instructions auto-decrement the pointer registers, processing the data in reverse order.
- **Control:** The DF is typically manipulated using the CLD (Clear Direction Flag, sets DF to 0) and STD (Set Direction Flag, sets DF to 1) instructions.

## Zero Flag (ZF)

- Indicates whether the result of an arithmetic or logical operation is zero.

- **ZF = 1:** The operation’s result is zero.
- **ZF = 0:** The result is nonzero.

- Used in conditional jump instructions like JE (jump if equal) and JZ (jump if zero) to control program flow based on the outcome of comparisons or operations.
