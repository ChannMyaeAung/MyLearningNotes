# Division and Multiplication

- With addition and subtraction, if a value goes beyond the space we provided, it will only be a single bit.
- Hence, the processor can use the `%eflags` register to store the value of this bit using the carry flag (CF) and the overflow flag (OF).
- But with multiplication, the size of the destination can **double**.

```css
  9  9  9
  9  9  9   +
1 9  9  8
```

- It only extends a single digit beyond the original addends.
- This is small enough to be stored in a single digit (which in binary is the carry flag in `%eflags`).

```css
  	   9  9  9
  	   9  9  9   *
9 9 8  0  0  1
```

- Multiplication has the ability to double the number of digits required.
- What happens if we multiply two 64-bit numbers and the result is larger than 64 bits?
- To solve this, the CPU stores the result of multiplication in **two registers**.
- If the result overflows `%rax`, then the additional bits are stored in `%rdx`.
- When two registers are combined together this way (results in a 128-bit), if is often written out as `%rdx:%rax` (high order in `%rdx`, low order in `%rax`).
- The div instruction is the opposite.
- The dividend is stored in `%rdx:%rax` and the divisor is specified as an operand to the instruction.
- The quotient is stored in `%rax` and the remainder in `%rdx`.
- `mul` and `div` are unsigned instructions.
- The signed versions of these instructions are `imul` and `idiv`.
  - Can be used with one, two, or three operands.
  - When used with a single operand, it behaves similarly to `mul` but for signed numbers.

## Additional Things to Consider

- Check `%rdx` after multiplication to detect overflow if the product exceeds the size of `%rax`.
- `imul` has variants that allow more control (e.g., three-operand form) where we can directly store the result in a destination register.

- **Dividend Preparation:**

  - **Unsigned Division (`div`):**
    - Zero out `%rdx` before performing division if the dividend fits entirely in `%rax`.
  - **Signed Division (`idiv`):**
    - Use instructions like `cdq` (for 32‑bit) or `cqo` (for 64‑bit) to sign extend `%rax` into `%rdx` so that the full dividend is correctly formed.

  - **Operand Size:**
    - Similar to multiplication, ensure that the operand sizes match and you’re using the appropriate version of the instruction.
  - **Overflow/Range Errors:**
    - Ensure the quotient fits into `%rax`. If the quotient is too large, a division error (interrupt/exception) will occur.
