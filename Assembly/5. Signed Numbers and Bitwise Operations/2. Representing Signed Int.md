# Representing Signed Integers

- Two's complement is the most common way to represent signed integers in modern computer systems (including in assembly)
  - as it allows the same hardware circuitry to perform addition and subtraction for both positive and negative numbers.
- The way that it works is while positive integers count up from zero, negative integers count back from zero.

## How Two's Complement Mechanism Works

For an N‑bit number:

- **Positive Numbers:**
  - They are represented normally in binary (with the most significant bit (MSB) set to 0).
- **Negative Numbers:**
  - To represent a negative number (–x),  we take the binary representation of x, invert all the bits (this is known as the one's complement), and then add 1. 
  - This process produces the two's complement representation.

For example:

- The positive number 5 is represented as:

```css
00000101
```

- To represent –5:

  1. Invert the bits:

     ```css
     11111010
     ```

  2. Add 1:

     ```css
     11111010
     +      1
     --------
     11111011
     ```

- On a 64-bit system, integers are stored in 64 bits. The most significant bit (bit 63) is the sign bit (sign flag):

  - If it’s 0, the number is non-negative.
  - If it’s 1, the number is negative.
