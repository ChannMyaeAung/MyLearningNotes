## `testb`

- Performs a bitwise AND between two byte operands.

- Does not store the result; it only updates the condition flags (e.g., zero flag, sign flag).

- Commonly used to test whether specific bits are set in a byte.

- **Example**: Suppose we want to check if the least significant bit (bit 0) of the byte in register `%al` is set.

  ```assembly
  movb $0x03, %al    # Load 0x03 (binary 0000 0011) into %al.
  testb $0x01, %al   # AND %al with 0x01 (binary 0000 0001); flags updated.
                     # Zero flag is clear because 0x03 & 0x01 == 0x01 (non-zero).
  jz bit_not_set     # Jump if zero flag is set (bit 0 not set).
  ; Code here runs if bit 0 is set.
  ```

  - In this example, since `%al` contains 0x03 (binary 0000 0011), the operation `testb $0x01, %al` performs a bitwise AND:
    - 0x03 AND 0x01 = 0x01 (non-zero), so the zero flag is cleared.

## `orb`

- Performs a bitwise OR operation on two byte operands.

- Stores the result in the destination operand.

- Useful for setting specific bits in a byte.
- **Example:** Suppose we want to set bit 5 (i.e., OR with 0x20) in the `%al` register.

```assembly
movb $0x03, %al    # Load 0x03 (binary 0000 0011) into %al.
orb  $0x20, %al    # OR %al with 0x20 (binary 0010 0000).
                   # The new value in %al becomes 0x23 (binary 0010 0011).
```

- Here, the bitwise OR sets bit 5 in `%al`. The operation works as follows:
  - 0x03 (0000 0011) OR 0x20 (0010 0000) yields 0x23 (0010 0011).
