# Exercises

1. Write a program that adds two signed numbers. If the addition overflows, it should give back 1; otherwise, it should give back 0.

```assembly
.globl _start
.section .text
_start:
    # Load first signed number into %rax.
    movq $0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, %rax   # %rax = 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (max positive 64-bit signed int)
    
    # Load second signed number into %rbx.
    movq $1, %rbx                    # %rbx = 1

    # Add %rbx to %rax. This addition should overflow.
    addq %rbx, %rax                  # Result is computed, and overflow flag (OF) is set if overflow occurs.
    
    # Use the 'seto' instruction to set AL to 1 if overflow occurred, 0 otherwise.
    seto %al                         # If OF==1 then AL becomes 1; else AL becomes 0.
    
    # Zero-extend AL to the full 64-bit register %rax.
    movzx %al, %rax                  # %rax now contains 0 or 1.

    # Move the result into %rdi as the exit code.
    movq %rax, %rdi                  # Exit code is now in %rdi.  
    movq $60, %rax                   
    syscall
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as test.s -o test.o
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld test.o -o test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
1
```

**If we changed it to a number that won't overflow (3)**:

```assembly
movq $3,  %rax
...
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as test.s -o test.o
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld test.o -o test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
0
```

2. Write a program that uses a combination of masks and rotates to count the number of 1s in a register.

```assembly
.globl _start
.section .text
_start:
    # Load a test 64-bit number into %rax.
    # For example, 0xF0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0 has 32 one-bits.
    movq $0xF0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0, %rax

    # Clear %rcx to use as the bit counter.
    xor %rcx, %rcx

    # Set up a loop counter in %rdx for 64 iterations.
    movq $64, %rdx

count_loop:
    # Test the least-significant bit (LSB) of %rax.
    testq $1, %rax       # This sets flags based on the value of LSB.
    jz skip_inc          # If the bit is 0, jump to skip_inc.
    inc %rcx             # If the bit is 1, increment our counter.

skip_inc:
    # Shift %rax right by 1 bit to process the next bit.
    shrq $1, %rax

    # Decrement loop counter; loop until 64 bits have been processed.
    dec %rdx
    jnz count_loop

    # Move the bit count (number of 1s) from %rcx to %rdi as the exit code.
    movq %rcx, %rdi

    movq $60, %rax
    syscall
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as test.s -o test.o
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld test.o -o test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
32
```

- Each byte is F0, which in binary is 1111 0000 (4 ones per byte). 
- Since there are 8 bytes in a 64-bit value, the total number of 1s is: 
  - 4 ones/byte × 8 bytes = 32
