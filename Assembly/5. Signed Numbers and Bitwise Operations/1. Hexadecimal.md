# Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal and Octal Numbers

- With decimal, it's hard to tell fromt he the size of the number how many bytes it takes up.
- In **hexadecimal**, every hexadecimal digit is exactly 4 bits, and every two hexadecimal characters is exactly 1 byte. 
- It is often thought of as a "condensed binary".
- To write hexadecimal in code, we use the prefix `0x` at the beginning of the numbers.
- `0x31` = hexadecimal 31 = 3 x 16 + 1 = 49 in decimal.
- In the GNU Assembler, **merely starting a number with zero switches to octal.**
  - Thus, if we write 053 instead of 53, the actual value will be computed as 5 x 8 + 3 = 43.
- Any immediate-mode value will need to be prefixed with a `$`.
- If we want to load %rax with the hexadecimal number 7A, we would do it like:

```assembly
movq $0x7A, %rax
```
