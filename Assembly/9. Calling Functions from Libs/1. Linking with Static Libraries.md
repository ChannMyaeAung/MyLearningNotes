# Linking with Static Libraries

- Two general types of libraries on Linux:
  - static libraries
  - shared libraries
- **Static Libraries** contain code that get directly added to our program.
  - Typically end with a `.a` extension (archive).
- A **shared library** (or dynamic library) is a compiled library stored as a separate file (typically with a `.so` extension on Linux).
  - When we build our program to use a shared library, the library isnâ€™t embedded into our executable
  - Instead, the operating system loads it at runtime. 
  - This allows multiple programs to share a single copy of the library in memory and makes it easier to update the library independently of our program.
