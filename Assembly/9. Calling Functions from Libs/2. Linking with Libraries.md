# Linking with Libraries

- `abs` takes one input param (a positive or negative integer) and yields the absolute value of that parameter.
- What we are going to do is to load a negative number into `%rdi` and then call `abs` to convert it to a positive number.

```assembly
.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
.globl _start
.section .text
_start: 
    movq $-5, %rdi
    call abs

    # result is in %rax, move to %rdi for exit
    movq %rax, %rdi 
    movq $60, %rax 
    syscall 
```

- The `.section .note.GNU-stack` directive tells the assembler that the stack is **non-executable** which is the recommended and secure behavior.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as test.s -o test.o
test.s: Assembler messages:
test.s:10: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld test.o -static -lc -o test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
5
```

- The `-static` tells the linker that we want to physically incorporate the library functions into our program.
- The `-lc` tells the linker to link with the `c` library.
- It takes the `c` and expands it to `libc.a` since we are looking for a static library.
