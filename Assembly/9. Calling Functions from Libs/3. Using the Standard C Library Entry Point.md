# Using the Standard C Library Entry point

- Occasionally, some C functions require that certain setup functions have been run.
- Because of this, when linking with other libraries, it is common to not define `_start` in our program, but to instead define `main`.
- `_start` gets linked in from a separate library, which performs all necessary C library initialization.

```assembly
.globl main
.section .text 
main:
	movq $-5, %rdi
	call abs
	
	# the result is already in %rax, so we just need to return
	# since main is called from the standard C library, we just need to return rather than call the exit system call
	ret
```

- We don't have to call the `exit` system call.
- The C runtime library does that for us using the return value from `main`.

```sh'
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ gcc test.s -static -o test
test.s: Assembler messages:
test.s: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
