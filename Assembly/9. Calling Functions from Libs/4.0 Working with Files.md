# Working with Files

- The C library handles a lot of complexity of Linux system calls for us and we only need to concern ourselves with the actual reading and writing of data.
- Opening a file will return an **opaque pointer** to us which represents the file and then we pass that back to other functions we need to work with the file.
- An **opaque pointer** simply means that we don't have to worry about the specific data that the pointer points to.
  - We just have to keep track of it and use it to refer to the file we are dealing with.
  - The specific data that the pointer points to is managed entirely by the C library.
- If the `open` fails for any reason, then the call returns the literal value zero in %rax instead of the pointer.
- When a program has a zero in place of a pointer, that is called a **null pointer** because it is supposed to be a pointer to something, but instead points to nothing.
- Many functions return null pointers instead of real pointers when failures occur.
- On functions that take a varying number of arguments (**variadic functions**), we should set `%rax` to zero if we are not passing any floating-point values.
  - E.g. `fprintf` can take a variable number of args, `%rax` should be set to zero before calling this function.
