# Finalizers

- Finalizers are cleanup functions that are automatically invoked just before an objectâ€™s memory is reclaimed. 
- They are used in environments with automatic memory management (like garbage collected languages) to perform necessary resource cleanup such as closing file descriptors, freeing network sockets, or performing other release tasks that cannot be handled by simply freeing memory.
  - This ensures that any lingering external dependencies are properly shut down, preventing resource leaks and potential errors in our program.
- They complement garbage collection by enabling programmers to perform additional cleanup tasks that go beyond simply reclaiming memory.
