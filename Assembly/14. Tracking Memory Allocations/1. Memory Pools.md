# Memory Pools

- Memory pools are like multiple areas of memory from which we can request allocations and deallocations.
- Imagine segmenting out our memory so that not only do we request an amount of memory we want, we also request which memory pool we want it allocated from.

---

## Code Example

- The program allows a user to specify a pool number to allocate from and also provides a `deallocate_pool` func to deallocate all allocations from a particular pool.
- It has an additional field on each allocation which is the pool number that the allocation belongs to.
- When deallocating a pool, the deallocator simply walks the list of memory allocations and deallocates each one that belongs to the pool.
