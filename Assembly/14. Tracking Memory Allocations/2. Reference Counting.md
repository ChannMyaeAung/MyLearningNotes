# Reference Counting

- Memory pools are nice, but the problem with them is that their usage is tied to fairly specific application styles and life cycles.
- A more general way to semiautomate memory management is with **reference counting**.
- Reference counting automatically tracks how many parts of a program are using a piece of memory by maintaining a counter (called the **reference count** or **refcount**) stored on the memory. 
  - When this counter reaches zero, the memory is deallocated.
- Every time a new reference is made to the memory (or a pointer is stored), the counter is incremented. 
- When a reference is removed (pointer reassigned or goes out of scope), the counter is decremented.
- **Overhead**: system adds runtime overhead since the counter must be updated and checked continuously.
- **Circular References Issue:** If two or more objects refer to each other (circular references), their counters may never drop to zero. Weak pointers can help break cycles, but they bring their own challenges.
- **Ownership Ambiguities:** Edge cases occur with object ownership. 
  - For example, deciding what the reference count should be when an object is returned from a function, and determining who is responsible for freeing it if the result is ignored.
- The programming languages most famous for reference counting are Objective-C and Swift.

## Code Example

`run.s`

```assembly
.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
.globl allocate, deallocate, retain, release 

.section .data 
memory_start:
    .quad 0

    .quad 0

.section .text
.equ HEADER_SIZE, 16
.equ HDR_IN_USE_OFFSET, 0
.equ HDR_SIZE_OFFSET, 8
.equ REFCOUNT_OFFSET, -16

.equ BRK_SYSCALL, 12 

retain:
    incq REFCOUNT_OFFSET(%rdi)
    ret

    decq REFCOUNT_OFFSET(%rdi)
    ret 

# Register usage:
# %rdx: size requested
# %rsi: pointer to current memory being examined
# %rcx: copy of memory_end

allocate_init:
    # find the program break
    movq $0, %rdi 
    movq $BRK_SYSCALL, %rax 
    syscall 

    # The current break will be both the start and end of our memory
    movq %rax, memory_start

    syscall 

    # address is in %r8 - mark size and availability
    movq $1, HDR_IN_USE_OFFSET(%r8)
    movq %rdx, HDR_SIZE_OFFSET(%r8)

    # Actual return value is beyond our header
    addq $HEADER_SIZE, %r8 
    movq %r8, %rax 
    ret 

allocate: 
    # Save the amount requested into %rdx
    movq %rdi, %rdx 

    # Actual amount needed is actually larger
    addq $HEADER_SIZE, %rdx 

    # if we haven't initialized, do so
    cmpq $0, memory_start 
    je allocate_init 

allocate_continue:
    movq memory_start, %rsi 
    movq memory_end, %rcx 

allocate_loop: 
    # if we have reached the end of memory
    # we have to allocate new memory by moving the break

    je allocate_move_break 

    # is the next block available?
    cmpq $0, HDR_IN_USE_OFFSET(%rsi)
    jne try_next_block

    # is the next block big enough?
    cmpq %rdx, HDR_SIZE_OFFSET(%rsi)
    jb try_next_block 

    # this block is great!
    # mark it as unavailable 
    movq $1, HDR_IN_USE_OFFSET(%rsi)

    # move beyond the header 
    addq $HEADER_SIZE, %rsi 

    # return the value 
    movq %rsi, %rax 
    ret 

try_next_block:
    # This block didn't work, move to the next one 
    addq HDR_SIZE_OFFSET(%rsi), %rsi
    jmp allocate_loop 

deallocate: 
    # Free is simple - just mark the block as free
    movq $0, HDR_IN_USE_OFFSET - HEADER_SIZE(%rdi)
    ret 
```

`run.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void *allocate(int);
void retain(void *);
void release(void *);
void deallocate(void *);

int main()
{
    printf("Starting memory tests...\n");

    char *a = allocate(500);
    printf("Allocated a at %p\n", a);

    retain(a);
    retain(a);
    release(a);

    char *b = allocate(300); // new allocation
    printf("Allocated b at %p\n", b);

    retain(a);
    release(a);
    release(a);

    char *c = allocate(300);
    printf("Allocated c at %p\n", c);

    release(a); // obj is deallocated here

    char *d = allocate(300); // reuses space from a
    printf("Allocated d at %p\n", d);

    printf("Test complete\n");
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./run
Starting memory tests...
Allocated a at 0x9c83010
Allocated b at 0x9c83214
Allocated c at 0x9c83350
Allocated d at 0x9c83010
Test complete
```

1. **Allocation of `a` at `0x9c83010`**:

   - We allocate 500 bytes for `a` with initial refcount = 1

2. **Reference count manipulations**:

   ```c
   retain(a); // refcount = 2
   
   retain(a); // refcount = 3
   
   release(a); // refcount = 2
   ```

   - After these operations, `a` has a refcount of 2.

3. **Allocation of `b` at `0x9c83214`**:

   - Since `a` is still in use (refcount = 2), the allocator creates a new memory block.
   - Address is different from `a` as expected

4. **More reference count manipulations**:

   ```c
   retain(a); // refcount = 3
   
   release(a); // refcount = 2
   
   release(a); // refcount = 1
   ```

   - After these operations, `a` has a refcount of 1.

5. **Allocation of `c` at `0x9c83350`**:

   - Since `a` is still in use (refcount = 1), allocator creates another new block.
   - Address is different from both `a` and `b`

6. **Deallocation of `a`**:

   ```c
   release(a); // refcount = 0, memory is freed
   ```

   - The final release causes `a`'s refcount to reach 0.
   - The deallocate function is called, marking the memory as free.

7. **Reuse of `a`'s memory for `d` at `0x9c83010`**:

   - The allocator reuses the first block (which was `a`).
   - `d` gets the exact same address that `a` had.
   - This confirms that our memory reuse is working correctly.

**Summary:**

1. **Memory reuse**: When `d` gets the same address as `a`, it shows our allocator is correctly marking memory as free when reference count hits zero and reusing that space later.
2. **Separate allocations**: `b` and `c` get different addresses because `a` was still referenced when they were allocated.
3. **Reference counting behavior**: The retain/release operations correctly managed the reference count, only freeing when the count hit zero.

**The program & output demonstrates:**

- Reference counting for determining when to free memory.
- First-fit allocation strategy for finding free blocks.
- Memory reuse when blocks are freed.
