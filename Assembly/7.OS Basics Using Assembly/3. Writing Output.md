# Writing Output

- The write system call number is 1 (0x01).
- The 1st param to the system call (stored in `%rdi`) is the file descriptor.
- The 2nd param (stored in `%rsi`) is a pointer to the data to write out.
- The 3rd param (stored in `%rdx`) is the length of this data.

```assembly
.globl _start
.section .data
mystring:
    .ascii "Hello, there!\n"

mystring_end:
.equ mystring_length, mystring_end - mystring 

.section .text
_start:
    # syscall number for sys_write
    mov $1, %rax 

    # file descriptor 1 (stdout)
    mov $1, %rdi 

    # pointer to the data
    mov $mystring, %rsi

    # length of the data
    mov $mystring_length, %rdx 
    syscall

    # exit
    mov $0x3c, %rax 
    mov $0, %rdi
    syscall
```

- We didn't end the string with a null terminator because the system call uses string length instead of a sentinel character to determine the end of string.

- The three params (file descriptor, string start address, and string length) are loaded into `%rdi`, `%rsi`, and `%rdx`, respectively.

- All system calls will put their parameters in the order specified by (recap: The orders are

  1. %rdi
  2. %rsi
  3. %rdx
  4. %r10
  5. %r8
  6. %r9 )

  - Because that's how the OS knows what to do with those params.

- This is known as **calling convention**.

- By choosing a convention, this allows the program and the OS to communicate.
