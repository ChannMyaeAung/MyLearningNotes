# Making a system call

- For system calls that need more than one piece of information, the kernel expects the first six parameters to be placed in specific registers. 
- The order is:
  1. %rdi
  2. %rsi
  3. %rdx
  4. %r10
  5. %r8
  6. %r9
- It’s chosen because it minimizes the work the kernel has to do when handling the system call. 
- If a particular system call doesn’t need all six parameters, any extra registers are simply ignored.
- Most system calls return a result, and that result is placed in `%rax`. 
- However, two registers are automatically overwritten by the syscall instruction:
  - **%rcx:** This register is used to store the return address (the location where our program should resume once the system call is finished).
  - **%r11:** This register gets the current flags (from the `%eflags` register) during the syscall.
- Because `%rcx` and `%r11` get clobbered, if one's code has important data in those registers that they need after the system call, they should save (or "push") them to another location before the call and restore them afterwards.
- We can find a list of system calls by running `man 2 syscalls` from the command line.
