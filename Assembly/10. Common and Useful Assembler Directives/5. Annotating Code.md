# Annotating Code

- For symbols marked with `.globl`, the `.type` directive lets the linker know what kind of symbol it is - whether function (@function) or data(@object).

```assembly
.globl myvar, myfunc
.type myvar, @object
.type myfunc, @function

.section .data
myvar:
	.quad 0
.section .text
myfunc:
	# Do things
	ret 
```

- `.cfi_`: If we see directives starting with that, they are essentially information items passed to debuggers and other tools to describe the intended flow of the program.
