# Exercise

1. Go through some of the code written for previous chapters and make use of these new directives:
   1. Convert .ascii directives to .string.
   2. Add .type annotations to symbols marked as .globl.
   3. Replace .quad directives with .8byte.
   4. Replace .quad directives where the initial value isnâ€™t used with a .skip directive or an .lcomm directive. Also, move the data into the .bss section.
   5. Look for values which are not modified and move them to the .rodata section.

```assembly
.section .rodata
mystr: .string "Assembly Programming is fun!\n"

some_const: .8byte 0x123456789ABCDEF0 # 64 bit constant 

.section .bss 
.lcomm data, 16 # 16 bytes uninitialized data
.lcomm value, 8 # 8 bytes uninitialized data

.section .text
.globl _start
.type _start, @function 
_start: 
	# write the message to stdout
	movq $1, %rax # stdout
	movq $mystr, %rsi 
	movq $29, %rdx # length of the string
	movq $1, %rax # syswrite 
	syscall 

	# exit 
	movq $60, %rax
	syscall
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as practice.s -o practice.o
practice.s: Assembler messages:
practice.s: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld practice.o -o practice
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./practice
Assembly Programming is fun!
```
