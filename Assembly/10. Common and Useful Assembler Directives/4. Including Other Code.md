# Including Other Code

- The `.include` will include the given file into our source code.
- Included files usually don't contain any code or data at all.
- For embedding binary data (like an image) directly into our object file, we can use `.incbin` to include the raw file content. 

```assembly
.section .data
myimage:
	.incbin "myimage.png"
```
