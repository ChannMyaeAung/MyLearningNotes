# Reserving Space for Data

- The directives `.2byte`, `.4byte`, and `.8byte` take up exactly as much space as they indicate.

- We can use the `.skip` directive to simply reserve space.

- `.skip` takes one or two args.

  - 1st arg: the number of bytes to reserve
  - 2nd arg (optional): the value to put in these reserved locations.
    - If not specified, the value will be 0.

- `.space` and `.zero` both do the same thing.

- If we wanted to reserve a 1000-byte space, we could do so:

  ```assembly
  mydata:
  	.zero 1000
  ```

- Another data-oriented operation is `.string`. (identical to `.ascii` but it automatically appends the null byte to the end). (synonym = `.asciz`).
