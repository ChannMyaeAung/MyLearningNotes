# The %rip Register and the jmp Instruction

- %rip (a special-purpose register) - the instruction pointer simply points to the next memory location that the processor is going to process an instruction from.
  - This lets the CPU know where to pull the next instruction from when the next clock cycle runs.
- This register can be manipulated thru `jump` instructions.
- A jump instruction tells the computer to alter the normal sequential flow of program execution.
- Instead of executing instructions one after another, a jump instruction directs the CPU to continue execution from a different location in memory. 
  - Fundamental for creating control flow constructs such as loops, conditionals, and function calls.

## Code Example

```assembly
.globl _start

.section .text
_start:
    movq $7, %rdi
    jmp nextplace

    # These two instructions are skipped
    movq $8, %rbx
    addq %rbx, %rdi

nextplace:
    movq $60, %rax
    syscall
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as test.s -o test.o
test.s: Assembler messages:
test.s: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld test.o -o test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
7
```

- When the instruction `jmp nextplace` is issued, that tells the CPU to alter its instruction pointer so that the next instruction to execute will be the one at the memory address labeled by `nextplace`, skipping the two instructions in the middle.

## Nest of Jumps

```assembly
.globl _start

.section .text
_start:
    movq $25, %rax 
    jmp thelabel 

somewhere:
    movq %rax, %rdi 
    jmp anotherlabel

label1:
    addq %rbx, %rax 
    movq $5, %rbx
    jmp here

labellabel:
    syscall

anotherlabel:
    movq $60, %rax
    jmp labellabel

thelabel:
    movq $60, %rax
    jmp labellabel

here:
    divq %rbx
    jmp somewhere

there:
    addq $5, %rbx
    jmp somewhere

anywhere:
    jmp thelabel
```

1. **Start**:
   - The program starts at `_start`.
   - `movq $25, %rax`: Moves the value 25 into `%rax`.
   - `jmp thelabel`: Jumps to `thelabel`.
2. **Thelabel**:
   - `movq $60, %rax`: Moves the syscall number 60 (sys_exit) into `%rax`.
   - `jmp labellabel`: Jumps to `labellabel`.
3. **Labellabel**:
   - `syscall`: Executes the syscall to exit the program with the status in `%rdi`.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as test.s -o test.o
test.s: Assembler messages:
test.s: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld test.o -o test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
0
```

- The program jumps directly from `_start` to `thelabel`, then to `labellabel`, and finally executes the `syscall` instruction.
- The `%rdi` register, which holds the exit status, is never explicitly set before the `syscall` instruction is executed.
- Since `%rdi` is not set, it defaults to 0, resulting in an exit status of 0.
