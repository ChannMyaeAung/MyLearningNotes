# Comparisons

- If we issued the command `cmpq %rbx, %rax`, then the CPU would actually subtract %rbx from %rax.
- Rather than storing the result, it would just set the flags and discard the result.
- The flags will indicate that either %rbx and %rax are the same.
- Given the command `cmpq ARG1, ARG2`:
  - `je` : jump if ARG2 equals ARG1.
  - `jne`: jump if ARG2 does not equal ARG1.
  - `ja` : jump if ARG2 > ARG1.
  - `jae` : jump if ARG2 >= ARG1.
  - `jb`: jump if ARG2 < ARG1.
  - `jbe`: jump if ARG2 <= ARG1.

## Code Example

```assembly
.globl _start

.section .text

_start:
    # Set up a test value in %rax
    movq $10, %rax # %rax = 10

    # Compare the value in %rax with 10
    cmpq $10, %rax # this subtracts 10 from %rax (without storing the result) and sets the flags

    # ZF (zero flag) is set if %rax equals 10.

    # Conditional jump based on the result of the comparion:
    je equal_label # Jump if ZF is set (%rax == 10)

    # If the jump is not taken, execution fails here:
_not_equal_label:
    movq $1, %rdi
    jmp exit_label


equal_label:
    # For the equal case, set exit code to zero
    xor %rdi, %rdi

exit_label:
    # Prepare to exit the program using the LInux syscall
    movq $60, %rax
    syscall
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as test.s -o test.o
test.s: Assembler messages:
test.s: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld test.o -o test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
0
```

- Since %rax is set to 10 and compared with 10, the zero flag (ZF) is set, and the program jumps to equal_label. 
- This sets the exit code to 0.
