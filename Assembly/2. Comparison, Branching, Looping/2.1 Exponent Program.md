# Exponent Program

```assembly
.globl _start

.section .text
_start:
    # %rbx will hold the base
    movq $2, %rbx

    # %rcx will hold the current exponent count
    movq $3, %rcx

    # Store the accumulated value in %rax
    movq $1, %rax

mainloop:
    # Adding zero will allow us to use the flags to determine if %rcx has zero to begin with
    addq $0, %rcx

    # If the exponent is zero, it's done
    jz complete

    # Otherwise, multiply the accumulated value by our base
    mulq %rbx

    # Decrease the counter
    decq %rcx

    # Go back to the beginning of the loop and try again
    jmp mainloop

complete:
    # Move the accumulated value to %rdi so we can return it
    movq %rax, %rdi
    movq $60, %rax
    syscall
```

- `movq $1, %rax`: Since anything raised to the zero power is 1, and the base multiplied by 1 is our first number anyway, the program starts by loading a 1 into %rax.
- `addq $0, %rcx`: By adding 0 to %rcx, this will set the zero flag on %eflags if the result is zero.
