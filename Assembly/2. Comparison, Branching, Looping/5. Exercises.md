# Exercises

1. Write a program that will multiply two numbers by repeatedly
   adding in a loop.

```assembly
.globl _start
.section .text
_start:
    # Initialize registers:
    movq $7, %r8 # Multiplicand = 7
    movq $5, %rcx # Multiplier = 5
    movq $0, %rax # Result accumulator = 0

multiply_loop:
    cmpq $0, %rcx # compare counter with 0
    je end_loop #if counter == 0, exit loop
    addq %r8, %rax # add multiplicand 7 to result
    decq %rcx # decrement counter
    jmp multiply_loop # repeat loop

end_loop:
    # move the result 35 to %rdi for exit code
    movq %rax, %rdi
    movq $60, %rax
    syscall
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as test.s -o test.o
test.s: Assembler messages:
test.s: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld test.o -o test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
35
```

2. Write a program that starts with a value in a register and yields a
   1 if that number is even and 0 if that number is odd.

```assembly
.globl _start
.section .text
_start:
    movq $8, %rax

    # prepare divisor 2 in %rbx and clear %rdx for division
    movq $2, %rbx # divisor: 2
    xor %rdx, %rdx # clear %rdx: required before using divq

    # Divide %rax by %rbx
    # After divq, quotient is stored in %rax and remainder in %rdx
    divq %rbx

    # check the remainder: if %rdx is 0, the number was even
    cmp $0, %rdx
    je even_label

odd_label:
    # number is odd; yield 0.
    movq $0, %rdi 
    jmp exit_program

even_label:
    # number is even; yield 1.
    movq $1, %rdi

exit_program:
    movq $60, %rax
    syscall
```

**Testing with value 8 (even number)**

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as test.s -o test.o
test.s: Assembler messages:
test.s: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld test.o -o test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
1
```

**Testing with value 9 (Odd number)**

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as test.s -o test.o
test.s: Assembler messages:
test.s: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld test.o -o test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
0

```

3. Implement the previous program by counting down in a loop
   rather than using the divq instruction.

```assembly
.globl _start
.section .text
_start:
    movq $9, %rax

countdown_loop:
    # if %rax is less than 2, stop subtracting
    cmpq $2, %rax
    jl check_remainder

    # Otherwise, subtract 2 and loop
    subq $2, %rax
    jmp countdown_loop

check_remainder:
    # if the remaining value is 0, the original number was even.
    cmpq $0, %rax
    je even_label

    # if the remaining value is 1, the original was odd.
    cmpq $1, %rax
    je odd_label

    # fallback (should not occur for non-negative int).
    movq $-1, %rax
    jmp exit_program

even_label:
    # Even: yield 1
    movq $1, %rdi
    jmp exit_program

odd_label:
    # odd: yield 0
    movq $0, %rdi

exit_program:
    movq $60, %rax
    syscall
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as test.s -o test.o
test.s: Assembler messages:
test.s: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld test.o -o test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
0
```
