# Conditional Jumping and the `%eflags` Register

- **Unconditional Jumps**: 
  - `jmp`immediately transfer control to the specified label or address without any conditions. 
  - They are used for implementing loops or for branching to common exit points.
- **Conditional Jumps**: 
  - Jumps (such as `je` for "jump if equal," `jne` for "jump if not equal," `jg` for "jump if greater," etc.) transfer control based on the state of specific flags set by previous instructions (for example, results from comparisons). 
  - This allows the program to decide between different execution paths based on computed conditions.
- `%eflags` register:
  - A central component in the x86 architecture that holds several condition flagsâ€”bits that represent the outcome of arithmetic and logical operations. 
  - Conditional jump instructions use these flags to determine whether to alter the flow of execution.
- `%eflags` register contains multiple flags.
- Flags important for conditional jumps:
  - **ZF (Zero Flag):** Set to 1 if the result of the last operation was zero, or 0 if it was not.
  - **CF (Carry Flag):** Set to 1 if an arithmetic operation generates a carry out or borrow (the result was bigger than could be held in the destination register).
  - **SF (Sign Flag):** Reflects the sign of the result (set if negative).
  - **OF (Overflow Flag):** Indicates when an arithmetic overflow occurs.
  - **PF (Parity Flag):** Set if the number of set bits in the result is even.
- Instructions like `cmp`, `sub`, `add`, and others perform operations that update these flags. 
  - For example, after a `cmp` (compare) instruction, the flags are set based on the result of subtracting the two operands (without storing the result). 
  - This outcome is then used to guide the next steps.
- **`je`/`jz` (Jump if Equal/Zero):**
  - jump if the zero flag is set to 1.
- **`jne`/`jnz` (Jump if Not Equal/Not Zero):**
  - jump if the zero flag is set to 0.
- **`jc` (Jump if Carry)**:
  - Jump if the carry flag is set to 1.
- **`jnc` (Jump if No Carry)**:
  - Jump if the carry flag is set to 0.
