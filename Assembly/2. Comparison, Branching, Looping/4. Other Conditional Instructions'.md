# Other Conditional Instructions

- Suffixes on jump instructions (e, ne, a, ae, b, be) are known as **condition codes**.
- `cmovgq %rax, %rbx` will move the contents of %rax into %rbx if the previous comparison determined a "greater than" condition.
- `cmovleq %rax, %rbx` will do the same if it was a "less than or equal" condition.
- `loopq` decrement %rcx and jump to the specified label if the result of the decrement is not zero.
- `loopeq` will only continue the loop (perform a jump) if the previous comparison resulted in equality (the zero flag is set).
- `loopneq` will only jump if the previous comparison resulted in inequality (the zero flag is not set).

```assembly

    # %rbx will hold the base
    movq $2, %rbx

    # %rcx will hold the current expo count
    movq $3, %rcx

    # Store the acc value in rax
    movq $1, %rax

    # if the component is equal to zero, we are done
    cmpq $0, %rcx 
    je complete

mainloop:
    # Multiply the acc value by our base
    mulq %rbx

    # decrement %rcx, go back to loop if %rcx is not yet zero
    loopq mainloop

complete:
    # Move the acc value to %rdi so we can return it
    movq %rax, %rdi
