# Reserving Space on the Stack

- If we want to reserve a space of 16 bytes on the stack, we can just simply subtract 16 from the stack pointer:

```assembly
subq $16, %rsp
```

- We have to remember to add it back when we are done with it:

```assembly
addq $16, %rsp
```

- On x86-64 systems, stack space by default is limited to 2 MB.
