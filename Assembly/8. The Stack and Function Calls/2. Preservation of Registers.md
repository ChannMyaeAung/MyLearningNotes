# Preservation of Registers

- The function being called should preserve the contents of the registers `%rbp`, `%rbx`, and `%r12` thru `%r15`.
  - If we are calling a function, any register other than these may be overwritten during the function call.
- Means if we want to use these registers, we have to save what is already there first to memory or the stack and restore them before we return.
- The remaining registers can be overwritten as needed.
