# Exercise

1. Create a function that, if given an even number, calls the factorial function with that value and, if given an odd number, raises that number to the third power using the exponent function. Then write a program that calls this function.

`cube.s`

```assembly
.globl cube 
.section .text 

cube:
    enter $16, $0

    movq %rdi, %rax


    imul %rdi, %rax # multiply result by n (result = n * n)
    imul %rdi, %rax # multiply result by n again (result = n * n * n)

    leave 
    ret
```

`factorialfunc.s`

```assembly
.globl factorial
.section .text

# this is the offset into the stack frame (%rbp) that we store the number for which we are taking the factorial.
.equ LOCAL_NUM, -8

factorial:
    # we will reserve space for 1 variable - the value we were called with
    # aligned to 16 bytes
    enter $16, $0

    # if the arg is 1, then return the result as 1.
    # otherwise, continue 
    cmpq $1, %rdi
    jne continue

    # return 1
    movq $1, %rax
    leave 
    ret 

continue:
    # save the arg into our stack storage
    movq %rdi, LOCAL_NUM(%rbp)

    # call factorial with %rdi decreased by one
    decq %rdi
    call factorial 

    # the result will be in %rax. Multiply the result by our first arg we stored on the stack
    mulq LOCAL_NUM(%rbp)

    # result is in %rax which is what is needed for the return value

    leave 
    ret 
```

`run.s`

```assembly
.globl _start
.section .text 
_start: 
    # call factorial with 4
    movq $5, %rdi
    call process_number

    movq %rax, %rdi
    movq $60, %rax 
    syscall 

process_number:
    test $1, %rdi # test the lowest bit; 0 means even
    jz call_factorial
    call cube
    ret

call_factorial:
    call factorial
    ret 
```



**Run the program with value `5`**

```sh

```



**Run the program with value `4`**

```assembly
.globl _start
.section .text 
_start: 
    # call factorial with 4
    movq $4, %rdi
    call process_number

    movq %rax, %rdi
    movq $60, %rax 
    syscall 

process_number:
    test $1, %rdi # test the lowest bit; 0 means even
    jz call_factorial
    call cube
    ret

call_factorial:
    call factorial
    ret 
```



```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as run.s -o run.o
run.s: Assembler messages:
