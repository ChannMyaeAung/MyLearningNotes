# Passing Input parameters

- Parameters come to the function primarily in registers.
- Params are identified by position, and the positions correspond to the registers as follows:
  1. `%rdi`
  2. `%rsi`
  3. `%rdx`
  4. `%r8`
  5. `%r9`
- If there is only one param, it gets passed in `%rdi`.
- If there are two, the first param is passed into `%rdi` and the 2nd is passed into `%rsi`.
- If there are more than 6 params, all additional params get pushed onto the stack as quadwords (using `pushq`).
- The last param gets pushed onto the stack first.

**Example**: We have a function called `myfunc` that should be given 10 params and we wanted to pass the value 1 as param 1, the value 2 as param 2, and so forth:

```assembly
movq $1, %rdi
movq $2, %rsi
movq $3, %rdx
movq $4, %rcx
movq $5, %r8
movq $6, %r9 
pushq $10
pushq $9
pushq $8
pushq $7
call myfunc
```

## Example Code

```assembly
.globl _start
_start:
    # Prepare parameters for a function call:
    mov $3, %rdi      # First param: 3 (in %rdi)
    mov $4, %rsi      # Second param: 4 (in %rsi)
    call add_numbers  

    # exit
    mov $60, %rax   
    syscall

add_numbers:
    add %rsi, %rdi   # Add second parameter to first.
    # The result is now in %rdi.
    ret
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as assembly.s -o assembly.o
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld assembly.o -o assembly
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./assembly
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
7
