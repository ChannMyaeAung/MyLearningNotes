# Loose Coupling and The importance of stack

- The stack lets a program save its current work (like register values) before moving to another task. 
  - It automatically saves return addresses, parameters, and local variables in a last-in, first-out order, which enables features like recursion and register preservation.
- This organized structure not only ensures correct **control flow** but also helps different parts of a program work independently (**loose coupling**), making modifications simpler and reducing the risk of errors.
  - When the program returns, it retrieves its saved values from the stack, keeping everything organized and making changes or updates easier without unintended side effects.
