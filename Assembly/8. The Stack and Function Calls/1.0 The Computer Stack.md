# The Computer Stack

- The stack is an area of memory that is reserved for stacking temporary items.
- The OS preallocates space for the stack and then puts the pointer to this memory in the **stack pointer (`%rsp`**).
- While pointers generally refer to the beginning of a memory region, at the beginning of a program `%rsp` points to the end of the memory region containing the stack.
- When we push something onto the stack, it does two things:
  - It decrements `%rsp` to point to the next location on the stack.
  - It copies the value to the location specified by `%rsp`.
- We can then get the values back using the `pop`.
