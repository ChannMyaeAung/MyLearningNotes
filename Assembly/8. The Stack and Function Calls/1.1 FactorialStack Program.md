# Factorial Stack Program 

- What the program will do is to start at a given value and push each value we want to multiply by on the stack. 
- Then we will pop from the stack and multiply until we get the final answer.

```assembly
.globl _start
.section .data 

value:
    .quad 5 

.section .text 
_start: 
    # push in the sentinel value
    pushq $0 

    # grab the value
    movq value, %rax 

    # push all the values from 1 to the current value to the stack 
pushvalue:
    pushq %rax 
    decq %rax 
    jnz pushvalue 

    # prepare for multiplying 
    movq $1, %rax 

multiply: 
    # get the next value from the stack and store it in rcx
    popq %rcx 

    # if it is the sentinel, we are done
    cmpq $0, %rcx 
    je complete 

    # multiply by what we have accumulated so far 
    # mulq multiplies %rax by %rcx and stores the result back in %rax
    mulq %rcx 

    # do it again
    jmp multiply 

complete:
    movq %rax, %rdi 
    movq $60, %rax 
    syscall 
```
