# Stack Frame

- A **stack frame** is a section of the call stack dedicated to a single function call. 

- It holds all the data the function needs during its execution, including:

  - **Return Address:** The location in the code where the function should return after finishing.

  - **Saved Frame Pointer (Base Pointer):** Often, the previous frame pointer (like `%rbp` on x86â€‘64) is saved so that the caller's stack frame can be restored after the function exits.

  - **Function Parameters:** Depending on the calling convention, some or all of the parameters may be stored on the stack.

  - **Local Variables:** Space is reserved in the stack frame for variables that the function uses.

  - **Saved Registers:** Registers that need to be preserved across function calls are saved in the stack frame.
