# Tail-Call Elimination

- Tail‑call elimination (also known as tail‑call optimization or TCO) is a compiler optimization technique that improves recursive function calls by reusing the current function's stack frame for a tail call, rather than creating a new one. 
- This optimization effectively converts recursive calls into iterations, eliminating the extra overhead of additional function calls and preventing excessive stack growth.
  - This not only eliminates waste in stack space usage, it also saves the processor a lot of time returning from the huge stack of recursive functions.
  - If each tail call is just a `jmp` instead of a `call`, then the stack is not building up, and the return of the last call is just single return instruction.

- A call is in tail position if it is the last operation performed before the function returns, there's no additional work to do once the function call completes.
  - The current stack frame can be discarded with a `leave` instruction.

- **How It Works:**
  - When the compiler detects a function call in tail position, it can optimize by replacing the current function’s stack frame with that of the callee.
  - Instead of pushing a new frame onto the call stack, the current frame is reused (or replaced), essentially turning the function call into a jump (or branch) to the called function’s code.

```c
int factorial(int value){
    return factorial_recursive(value, 1);
}

int factorial_recursive(int number, int value_so_far){
    if(number == 1){
        return value_so_far;
    }
    int curval = number * value_so_far;
    return factorial(number - 1, curval);
}
```



`factorialtail.s`

```assembly
.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
.globl factorial
.section .text 
factorial:
    # no stack frame needed, just get ready to call factorial_internal 

    # %rdi already has number, 
    # value_so_far gets set to 1 
    movq $1, %rsi 

    # we can eliminate this as a tail call as well!
    jmp factorial_internal 

factorial_internal:
    # no stack frame needed
    # %rdi has number 
    # %rsi has value_so_far

    cmpq $1, %rdi 
    je factorial_internal_completion 

    # multiply number and value_so_far
    movq %rsi, %rax 
    mulq %rdi 

    # next value 
    decq %rdi # num 
    movq %rax, %rsi # value_so_far 

    # Tail call elimination
    jmp factorial_internal 

factorial_internal_completion:
    # this is the base case - return value_so_far
    movq %rsi, %rax 
    ret 
```

`run.s`

```assembly
.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
.section .data
format_str:
    .ascii "%ld\n\0"

.section .text
.globl main
main:
    # Set up the stack frame
    enter $16, $0
    
    # Call factorial(5)
    movq $5, %rdi
    call factorial
    
    # Print the result
    movq %rax, %rsi
    leaq format_str(%rip), %rdi
    call printf
    
    # Return
    leave
    ret
```



```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ gcc -no-pie factorialtail.s run.s -o run
factorialtail.s: Assembler messages:

```

**Note:** This only works if 

- the very last thing the function does it make a function call 
- it returns exactly the value it received from this function call.
