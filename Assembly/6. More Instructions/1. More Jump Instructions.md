# More Jump Instructions

- There are four types of jump instructions:

- **short jump**: a jump that is within 127 bytes of the current instruction.

  - Allows the assembler to use less space for the instruction itself, encoding it in only 2 bytes.

- **near jump**: a jump that is somewhere within the current address space.

  - Encoded as being relative to the instruction pointer, using 32 bits.
  - We don't have to worry about figuring out the relative address as the assembler will do that for us.

- **far jump**: isn't really used anymore.

  - used to be that memory on x86 processers.

- **indirect jumps**: allow us to jump to an address that we won't know until runtime.

  - We will be storing the address we want to jump to in a memory location or a register.
  - The indirect jump will then read that memory or register location and then jump to the 64-bit address specified.
  - Utilize the same `jmp` instruction, but they have an `*` before their operand to signify that it is indirect. 
    - For example, `jmp *mytarget` will read the 64-bit address stored in `mytarget` and then jump to whatever location that specifies.

  ```assembly
  target_pointer:
  	.quad 0
  mycode:
  	movq $mytarget, target_pointer
  	jmp *target_pointer
  	
  mytarget:
  	...
  ```
