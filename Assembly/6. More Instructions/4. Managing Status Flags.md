# Managing Status Flags

- Instructions that we can use to clear or set flags in the status register:

- **clc**: Clears the carry flag (CF)

- **setc**: Sets the carry flag (CF)

- **cld**: Clears the direction flag (DF)

- **setd**: Sets the direction flag (DF)

- **lahf**: Loads the common flags from `%eflags` into `%ah` (lower 16-bit of %rax).

  - Used to save the state of these flags into a general-purpose register so that they can be examined or preserved.

    ```assembly
    # Suppose some operation has updated the flags.
    lahf          # AH now contains the lower 8 bits of the flags (SF, ZF, AF, PF, CF)
    # we can now, for example, move AH into another register or memory for later use.
    ```

    

- **sahf**: Stores the common flags from `%ah` into `%eflags`.

  - Used to restore a previously saved set of flag values from AH.

  - In 64‑bit mode only some of the flags can be modified by SAHF. 

    - E.g. the interrupt flag (IF) and direction flag (DF) are not affected.

    ```assembly
    # Assume AH contains a value we want to use to set the flags.
    sahf          # Stores AH into the lower 8 bits of RFLAGS/EFLAGS
    ```

- LAHF/SAHF were more common in 16/32‑bit code. 

- In 64‑bit mode, while they are still available, modern code may use other techniques to save and restore flag state if more comprehensive flag management is needed.
