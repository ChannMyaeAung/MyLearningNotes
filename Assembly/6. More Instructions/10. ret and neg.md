# ret and neg

`ret`:

- **ret** (return) is used to exit a subroutine (function) and transfer control back to the calling code.
- When a function is called, the return address (the address of the instruction immediately following the call) is pushed onto the stack.
- The **ret** instruction pops that return address off the stack and jumps to it.

```assembly
.globl _start
.globl double_value

_start:
    # Prepare the argument (10) in rdi for our function.
    movq $10, %rdi         # %rdi = 10

    # Call the subroutine double_value.
    # This pushes the return address onto the stack.
    call double_value

    # When double_value returns, the result is in %rax.
    # exit with the result as the exit code.
    movq %rax, %rdi     
    movq $60, %rax         
    syscall

# The subroutine that doubles its input.
double_value:
    # At entry, the argument is in %rdi.
    # double the value and return it in %rax.
    movq %rdi, %rax    
    addq %rax, %rax  

    # The ret instruction pops the return address from the stack
    # and jumps to it, effectively returning control to _start.
    ret
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as test.s -o test.o
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld test.o -o test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./test
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
20
```



`neg`:

- **neg** performs an arithmetic negation on its operand, effectively computing the two's complement.
- It transforms a value into its negative form (i.e. −x-x−x becomes xxx and vice versa).
- The operation is equivalent to subtracting the operand from zero.
- It affects the flags (like the Zero, Sign, and Overflow flags) based on the result.

```assembly
movq $5, %rax  ; %rax = 5
neg %rax       ; %rax becomes -5
```

- If `%rax` is zero, negating it leaves it unchanged.
- If `%rax` contains a nonzero value, `neg` sets the flags based on the result.
