# Logic Functions

- The `andq` instruction is used for **masking** bits.
  - If there is a subset of bits we are interested in, we can use the `andq` instruction to set all other bits of register `%rcx`.
  - E.g if I want to know the low-order three bits of register `%rcx`, I could do it with the instruction `andq $ob111, %rcx`.
- The most efficient way to load a register with the value of zero is to "exclusive or" it with itself.
  - This is fast because the instruction can be encoded with a smaller number of bytes.
  - To load zero into `%rax` efficiently, we can do `xorq %rax, %rax`. (This does set flags).
