# Copying Blocks of Memory

- `movsq` moves one quadword (8 bytes) at a time (available in 64â€‘bit mode).
- Prefixing `movsq` with the `rep` modifier will repeat the instruction multiple times, counting down using `%rcx` register as a counter.

```assembly
    mov   $num_qwords, %rcx  # number of quadwords to copy
    lea   source(%rip), %rsi
    lea   dest(%rip),   %rdi
    rep   movsq              # copy RCX quadwords from [RSI] to [RDI]
```

```assembly
.section .data
source:
	.quad 9, 23, 55, 1, 3
dest:
	.quad 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
.section .text
_start:
	movq $source, %rsi
	movq $dest, %rdi
	movq $3, %rcx
	req movsq
```

- When copying large blocks of data, this can move data very fast.
