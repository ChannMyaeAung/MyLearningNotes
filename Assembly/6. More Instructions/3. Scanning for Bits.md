# Scanning for bits

- Means examining a register or memory operand bit by bit to locate a bit that meets a certain condition (e.g., the first set or clear bit).

- `lzcntq`: Takes a source parameter, which is the operand to scan, counts the number of "leading zeros" in the operand, and stores the result in the destination operand.

  - E.g `%rbx = 23` (10111 with 59 leading zeroes in binary). If we performed `lzcntq %rbx, %rcx`, then the value will be stored in `%rcx`.

- `bsfq (bit scan forward)`: Finds the index of the least significant set bit (1) in a 64‑bit quadword.

  - If the source operand is nonzero, the index (0–63) is stored in the destination register.

  - If operand is zero, the Zero Flag is set and the destination is undefined.

    ```assembly
    movq $0x8000000000000000, %rax   # %rax = quadword with only bit 63 set
    bsfq %rax, %rcx                  # Scans forward; %rcx gets 63
    ```

- `bsrq (bit scan reverse)`: searches the opposite direction, starting at the most significant bit (bit 63).

  - ```assembly
    movq $0x0000000100000000, %rax   # %rax = quadword with bit 32 set
    bsrq %rax, %rcx                  # Scans reverse; %rcx gets 32
    ```

- **Note:** bits are counted from least significant to most significant, starting with zero.
