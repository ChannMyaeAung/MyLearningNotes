# Introduction

- **Library Programmer:** The programmer who is creating the data structures, functions and objects.
- **Application Programmer:** The programmer who is using those things.
- Computer memory consists entirely of numbers, so we have to know what numbers mean in order to use them.
- Due to OOP, the application programmer didn't have to pay as close attention to a specific layout of each data structure, but could operate on the data in a way that focuses on functionality.
- **Object-oriented Programming** is a style of programming and programming languages which allow us to treat data structures by their **functionality** rather than by their data layout. 
- Three key ideas:
  - Encapsulation
  - Polymorphism
  - Inheritance
