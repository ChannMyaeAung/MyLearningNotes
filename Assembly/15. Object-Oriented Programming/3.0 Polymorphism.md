# Polymorphism

- Polymorphism means “many shapes” and allows entities to be represented in different forms.
- In practical terms, it enables methods to operate differently on different classes even if they share the same name. 
  - For instance, a method named `draw()` might perform different actions in classes `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
- This can be implemented through method overriding (in subclasses) or through interfaces and abstract classes.

## Pseudo Code & Assembly Code Example #1

### Pseudo Code Example #1 

```pseudocode
// Base class 
class Animal{
	// Method to be overriden by subclasses
	method makeSound(){
		// Default implementation (could be empty or generic)
		print("O! Some Sound")
	}
}

// Subclass Dog overrides makeSound method
class Dog extends Animal{
	method makeSound(){
		print("Bark!")
	}
}

// Subclass Cat overrides makeSound method
class Cat extends Animal{
	method makeSound(){
		print("Meow!")
	}
}

// function that uses polymorphism
function playSound(animal: Animal){
	// calls the overriden method based on the actual obj passed
	animal.makeSound()
}

// Main Program
function main(){
	// create obj of subclasses
	dog = new Dog()
	cat = new Cat()
	
	// Both objs are treated as type Animal
	animals = [dog, cat]
	
	// Demonstrating polymorphism: each call to makeSound invokes the correct implementation
	for each animal in animals{
		playSound(animal)
	}
}

// Execute the program
main()
```

#### Explanation of the Pseudocode

1. **Base Class (`Animal`):**

   - The `Animal` class defines the method `makeSound()`. 

   - This method is designed to be overridden by any subclass that inherits from `Animal`.

2. **Subclasses (`Dog` and `Cat`):**

   - Both `Dog` and `Cat` extend the `Animal` class. 
   - They override the `makeSound()` method.

   - `Dog`’s implementation prints "Bark!".
   - `Cat`’s implementation prints "Meow!".

3. **Polymorphic Function (`playSound`):**

   - The function `playSound` accepts a parameter of type `Animal`.
   - Regardless of whether an object of `Dog` or `Cat` (or any other subclass of `Animal`) is passed, the correct overridden method is invoked during runtime.

4. **Dynamic Behavior in Main Program:**

   - In `main()`, instances of `Dog` and `Cat` are created. 
   - They are stored in an array of type `Animal`. 
   - When iterating through this array, despite all elements being referred to as `Animal`, calling `makeSound()` on each element produces different outputs according to the actual object type.

**Note:** 

- The pseudocode demonstrates how polymorphism allows a single interface (`makeSound()`) to operate differently based on the actual object's class. 
- This is powerful because it enables developers to write flexible and reusable code where the exact type of object is determined at runtime rather than at compile time.
- Polymorphism not only makes code maintenance easier but also enables more dynamic and extensible software designs.



### Assembly Code for the above Pseudo Code

```assembly
.section .data 
# define msg for each animal sound
dog_msg:
    .string "Bark!\n" # 6 bytes 
cat_msg:
	.string "Meow!\n" # 6 bytes

# define objs for each animal
# Each obj is simply a memory slot storing the address of its makeSound func.
dog_obj:
    .quad dog_makeSound # pointer to Dog's sound routine
cat_obj:
    .quad cat_makeSound 

.section .text 
.globl _start 

# function: dog_makeSound
# Writes "Bark!\n" to stdout 
dog_makeSound:
    enter $0, $0 

	# setup syscall for write
	mov $1, %rax # syscall number for write
	mov $1, %rdi # file descriptor 1 (stdout)
	lea dog_msg(%rip), %rsi 
	mov $6, %rdx # length of message
	syscall 

	leave 
	ret 

# Function: cat_makeSound 
# Writes "Meow!\n" to stdout 
cat_makeSound:
	enter $0, $0 

	mov $1, %rax 
	mov $1, %rdi 
	lea cat_msg(%rip), %rsi
	mov $6, %rdx 
	syscall 

	leave 
	ret 

# Function: playSound
# Accepts a pointer to an "Animal" structure in %rdi 
# The structure's first (and only) field is a pointer to the makeSound function
playSound:
	enter $0, $0

	mov (%rdi), %rax # load func pointer from the obj structure 
	call *%rax # call the func via the pointer (dynamic dispatch)

	leave
	ret 

_start:
	# demonstrate polymorphism by calling playSound with dog_obj and cat_obj 
	lea dog_obj(%rip), %rdi
	call playSound 

	lea cat_obj(%rip), %rdi
	call playSound 

	# Exit

	mov $60, %rax 
	syscall 
```
