# Duck Typing

- **Duck Typing** is a concept more common in dynamically typed languages. 
- The idea can be summarized by the phrase, **"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck."** 
- In practical terms:
  - **Behavior Over Type:**
    - Instead of checking an object’s type explicitly, the program checks whether the object supports the required behavior. 
    - For example, if an object has methods like `quack` and `waddle`, it is accepted as suitable even if its declared type does not belong to any duck-related class.
  - **Flexibility in Coding:**
    - Duck typing allows programs to be more flexible and generic. 
    - Since types aren’t enforced strictly at compile time, an object’s compatibility is determined solely by the methods and attributes it possesses. 
    - This approach is widely used in languages like Python or JavaScript.
