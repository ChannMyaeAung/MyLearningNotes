# Encapsulation

- The library programmer defines functions, called **methods** around the data structure to control how the data structure is manipulated and accessed.
- Applications programmers, rather than accessing the data structure entirely, use the methods instead.
- This allows a level of indirection and encapsulation which shields the application programmer from having to know too much about the internals of the data structure.

- **Encapsulation** involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (object) and restricting direct access to some of the objectâ€™s components.
- It encourages the use of public interfaces (methods) to interact with an object while keeping its internal implementation hidden (information hiding).
