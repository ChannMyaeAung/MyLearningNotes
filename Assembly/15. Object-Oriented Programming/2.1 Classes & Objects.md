# Classes and Objects

- **Class:** A blueprint or template that defines the structure (data fields) and behavior (methods) common to all objects of that type.
- **Object:** An instance of a class. When an object is created, it holds real values for the attributes defined by its class and can interact using its methods.

## Object Lifecycle Management:

An object's life cycle usually includes three types of functions:

- **Constructor:** A function (like `fopen`) that allocates, initializes, and returns a pointer to the data structure.
- **Methods:** Do all the main tasks of the obj. Functions (like `fprintf`) that use the pointer to perform operations on the object without revealing its internal workings.
  - We usually write methods such that the first param is a pointer to the object that the method is written for.
- **Destructor:** A function (like `fclose`) that cleans up the object, such as deallocating memory and closing resources.

```pseudocode
function main(){
    File *myfile = File.open("myfilename.txt", "w"); // constructor
    myfile.fprintf("Hello there!\n"); // methods
}
```

- The constructor is usually defined on the class itself.
- The destructor wasn't explicitly called.
  - This is true of many OOP Langugaes.
  - The destructor is called implicitly when the obj is garbage collected or goes out of scope.
