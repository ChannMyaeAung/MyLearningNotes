# Structural Typing

- In a structural type system, one type is considered compatible with another if **every** feature in the expected type appears with a matching name and type in the provided type.
- Compatibility is determined by the **shape** of the type (its members and their types) irrespective of any declared name or inheritance hierarchy.
- **Nominal Typing**: Compatibility requires that types share a common declared identity (e.g., the same class or interface name). 
  - Two types with identical structure but different names are considered incompatible unless explicitly related.
- **TypeScript** uses a structural type system for interfaces and object types, comparing only member names and types to determine compatibility.
  - So two interfaces with matching properties can be assigned to each other without casts.


```ts
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

function logPoint(p: Point): void {
  console.log(`Point at (${p.x}, ${p.y})`);
}

// Extra properties on the object are ignored as long as it has the required shape
const pt = { x: 10, y: 20, label: "A" };
logPoint(pt);
```

- This code compiles without error because TypeScript’s type compatibility is based on the structure of `pt`, not its declared type.
- Even though `pt` has an extra `label` property, it matches the `Point` interface exactly for `x` and `y`, so the assignment is allowed. 

---

- **Go** implements structural typing for its interfaces.
  - Any type that has the required methods automatically satisfies an interface, with no need for explicit declarations.


```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Printer is satisfied by any type that has a Print() method
type Printer interface {
    Print()
}

type Document struct {
    Content string
}

func (d Document) Print() {
    fmt.Println(d.Content)
}

func main() {
    var p Printer
    // Document implicitly implements Printer by having Print()
    p = Document{Content: "Hello, Go"}
    p.Print()
}
```

- In Go, interfaces are satisfied structurally: `Document` does not declare `implements Printer`, yet it matches because it defines `Print()`.
- This lets us write functions that accept any type with the right methods, fostering flexible, duck‑typed polymorphism without explicit inheritance.

## Pseudocode Illustration 

```pseudocode
function printCoord(c: { x: int; y: int }) {
    print(c.x, c.y)
}

point = { x: 10, y: 20, z: 30 }
printCoord(point)   // OK: point has x and y properties
```

- This works under structural typing because `point`’s shape satisfies the requirement.
