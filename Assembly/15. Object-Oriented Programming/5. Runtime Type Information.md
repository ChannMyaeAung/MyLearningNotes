# Runtime Type Information and Metaclasses

- At runtime, programs sometimes need to know more about the objects they manipulate—this is where **runtime type information (RTTI)** comes in. 
- RTTI is extra metadata attached to an object that tells the program details such as its specific class, what methods it supports, and which interfaces it implements. 
- Two common ways of implementing this are:
  - **Embedded Type Pointer:**
    - The object itself begins with a pointer to a table or structure that holds its type information (often called the metaclass). 
    - This arrangement makes it easy to access the type data even if the object’s actual structure isn’t known in detail by the caller.
  - **vtable-Embedded Function:**
    - Alternatively, the vtable (the table of function pointers used for dynamic dispatch) might reserve its first slot for a function that retrieves the RTTI. 
    - This ensures that every object using dynamic dispatch provides a uniform entry point to query type-related information.
- The “metaclass” in this context is simply the container for the RTTI. 
- It may be implemented as a simple structure (holding, for example, the class name, parent class pointers, and information about supported interfaces) or, in more complex systems, as a fully fledged class with its own methods and even its own metaclass.
