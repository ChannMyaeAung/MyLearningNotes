# Referencing the `.data` section 

- References to addresses in the `.data` section of the library are handled thru an addressing mode called **PC-relative addressing.**
  - The mode records addresses of data as an offset of the current instruction pointer.

`multbyten.s`

```assembly
.globl multbyten

.section .data 
ten:
    .quad 10

.section .text 
multbyten: 
    movq ten(%rip), %rax # utilizes PC-relative addressing
    imulq %rdi # multiply result by n (result = n * 10)
    ret
```

- The line `movq ten(%rip), %rax` utilizes PC-relative addressing. 
  - This says that we need the address `ten`, but to encode it as a relative offset of the instruction pointer at this location.
  - Thus, no matter where in memory the library (and its data) gets loaded, it will still know where `ten` is, because it is a fixed offset from that location in the code.
