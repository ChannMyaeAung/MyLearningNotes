# Position-Independent Executables 

- Not just libraries can be PIE, we can write our main program as if it were a shared library and then compile it to be a PIE. 
- Benefits: makes it harder to exploits to misuse our code because the executable itself may not be loaded into the normal location.

```assembly
.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
.globl main 

.section .data 
output:
    .ascii "hello\n\0"

.section .text 
main:
	enter $0, $0 

	movq stdout@GOTPCREL(%rip), %rdi 
	movq (%rdi), %rdi 
	leaq output(%rip), %rsi 
	call fprintf 

	movq $0, %rax 

	leave 
	ret 

```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ gcc -pie practice.s -o practice
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./practice
hello
```
