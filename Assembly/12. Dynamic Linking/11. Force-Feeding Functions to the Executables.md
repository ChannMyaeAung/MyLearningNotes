# Force-Feeding Functions to the Executables 

- The loader supports an env variable called `LD_PRELOAD` which preloads a library's symbols into an executable before it loads in the shared libraries requested by the executable. 
- We can use this feature to override library functions with our own, even if the code is already compiled, and we don't have access to the source code.
- This is often used to provide better versions of various system functions such as `malloc`, such as providing a more optimized version, or even providing a garbage-collecting version of it.
- In the following program, instead of doing what we wanted `fprintf` to do, it will instead print our msg using the `write` system call.

```assembly
.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
.globl fprintf 

.section .data 
mytext: 
    .ascii "I intercepted you!\n"

mytextend: 

.section .text 
fprintf: 
    movq $1, %rax # syscall number for write
    movq $1, %rdi # file descriptor 1 (stdout)
    leaq mytext(%rip), %rsi # address of the string
    movq $(mytextend - mytext), %rdx # length of the string
    syscall 
    ret 
```

- Here, we run our previous program `use_mymath`. 

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ gcc -shared fprintf_override.s -o liboverride.so
fprintf_override.s: Assembler messages:
fprintf_override.s:16: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ export LD_PRELOAD=./liboverride.so
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ ./use_mymath
I intercepted you!
I intercepted you!
I intercepted you!
```
