# Loading Libraries Manually 

- In addition to the loader loading libraries when our application starts, the `dlopen` and `dlsym` functions allow us to open a shared library and get symbol references from them.
- Often used for adding plugins to code.
- **`dlopen`:**
  - Loads a shared library at runtime into our process.
  - Takes a library file name (as a string) and flags (e.g., `RTLD_LAZY` for lazy symbol resolution) as parameters.
  - Returns a handle (a pointer) used to refer to the library in future dynamic linking operations.
- **`dlsym`:**
  - Searches for and returns the address of a symbol (a function or variable) from the dynamically loaded shared library.
  - Takes two parameters: the library handle (obtained from `dlopen`) and the symbol name (as a string).
  - Returns a pointer to the symbol, which can then be used for calling functions or accessing data.

## Code Example

- The following code will load the previous `libmymath.so` library manually, find the pointer to the `printstuff` function from the library and then call it.

```assembly
.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
.globl main 

.section .data 
filename: 
    .ascii "libmymath.so\0"
functionname: 
    .ascii "printstuff\0"

.section .text 
main: 
    enter $0, $0

    movq $filename, %rdi 
    movq $1, %rsi # the flag for lazy-loading 
    call dlopen 

    movq %rax, %rdi 
    movq $functionname, %rsi 
    call dlsym 

    call *%rax 

    leave 
    ret 
```

- To get access to these functions, we will need to link with the `libdl.so` lib. 

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ gcc -no-pie -rdynamic manual_load.s -ldl -o manual_load
manual_load.s: Assembler messages:
manual_load.s:24: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ ./manual_load
hello there
```
