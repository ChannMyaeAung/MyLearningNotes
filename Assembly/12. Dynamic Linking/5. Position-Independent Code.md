# Position-Independent Code 

- The problem with shared libraries is that the loader can actually map them anywhere in memory. 
- The location that a library is loaded into memory is known as the **base address**.
- Position Independent Code (PIC) is code that executes correctly regardless of where in memory it is loaded.
- PIC avoids hardcoded absolute memory addresses, instead using relative addressing (often relative to the instruction pointer). 
- This allows the same code to be loaded at different addresses without modification.
- Shared libraries must be position independent because they are loaded at different addresses in different processes. 
- PIC allows these libraries to be shared among programs while still ensuring correct behavior.
- PIC works well with security techniques like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), which randomizes memory addresses to prevent certain types of attacks.
