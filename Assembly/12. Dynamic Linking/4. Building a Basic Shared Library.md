# Building a Basic Shared Library 

`squareme.s`

```assembly

.globl squareme 

.section .text 
squareme: 
    movq %rdi, %rax 
    imulq %rdi 
    ret

`run_squareme.s`

```assembly
.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
.globl main 

.section .data 
value: 
    .quad 6 

output: 
    .ascii "The square of %d is %d\n\0"

.section .text 
main:
    enter $0, $0 

    movq value, %rdi 
    call squareme 

    movq stdout, %rdi 
    movq $output, %rsi 
    movq value, %rdx 
    movq %rax, %rcx 
    call fprintf 

    leave 
    ret

- Below we are going to build `run_square` against our shared library.
- The `-lmymath` arg says to link against the `libmymath.so` library (it automatically adds the lib prefix and .so suffix), and the `-L .` says to add the current directory to the list of directories to look in for libraries.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ gcc -shared squareme.s -o libmymath.so
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ gcc -no-pie run_squareme.s -lmymath -L . -o run_squareme
run_squareme.s: Assembler messages:
run_squareme.s:24: Warning: end of file not at end of a line; newline inserted
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ ./run_squareme
./run_squareme: error while loading shared libraries: libmymath.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

- If we try to run this command, it will give an error because while we told GCC where to find the library, the loader has no idea where it is.
- We have to tell the loader where else it should look for libraries as well.
- We can do that with the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` env variable.
- If we run `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.` and then run the command, it will work.

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ ./run_squareme
The square of 6 is 36
```
