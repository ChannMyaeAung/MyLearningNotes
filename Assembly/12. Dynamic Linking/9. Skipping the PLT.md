# Skipping the PLT

- When calling functions, we can actually skip the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) and call the entry in the Global Offset Table (GOT) directly.
- This will force the loader to load the value immediately before the program starts rather than lazy loading it like it does when called thru the PLT.
- Rather than issuing `call fprintf` or `call fprintf@plt`, we can use:

```assembly
call *fprintf@GOTPCREL(%rip)
```
