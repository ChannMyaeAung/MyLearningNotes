# Referencing Externally Defined Data 

- To reference externally defined data such as  `stdout`, we will have to do two-steps lookups using the GOT. (a special symbol, `GOTPCREL`).
- Let's say, we want to load `stdout` into `%rdi`. 
  - We could do this with just `movq stdout, %rdi`.
  - But we don't actually know where `stdout` will wind up living. (It's actually defined elsewhere).
  - Hence, we have to look up the address of `stdout` in the GOT and then use that address to load the actual value.

```assembly
# finds the location of the variable in the Global Offset Table using PC-relative addressing, then loads that into %rdi.
# GOTPCREL is a PC-relative location of GOT
movq stdout@GOTPCREL(%rip), %rdi


# uses that location to look up the value of stdout itself
movq (%rdi), %rdi
```



`printstuff.s`

```assembly
.globl printstuff 
.section .data 
mytext: 
    .ascii "hello there\n\0"

.section .text 
printstuff: 
    enter $0, $0 

    movq stdout@GOTPCREL(%rip), %rdi 
    movq (%rdi), %rdi 

    # Load the address of the string into %rsi using pc-relative addressing
    leaq mytext(%rip), %rsi 
    call fprintf@plt # call fprintf using the PLT 

    leave 
    ret 
```

- `enter` and `leave` are required when calling other functions in order to make sure that the stack is properly maintained.
