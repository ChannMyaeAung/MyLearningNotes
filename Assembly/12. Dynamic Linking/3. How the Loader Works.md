# How the Loader Works

- **Loading and Mapping:**
  - The loader reads the executable (typically in ELF format) and maps its segments: code (.text), initialized data (.data/.rodata), and uninitialized data (.bss) into the process’s virtual memory with proper permissions.
- **Symbol Resolution & Libraries:**
  - When the executable is built, some symbols (functions or data) are unresolved.
  - The linker records references to these symbols and notes which shared libraries should provide them (e.g., the C library is implicitly included).
  - The loader, at runtime, uses these library references to resolve symbols and fill in missing addresses.
- **Dynamic Linking with PLT and GOT:**
  - **PLT (Procedure Linkage Table):** Contains stubs (indirect jump instructions) for external functions.
  - **GOT (Global Offset Table):** Holds addresses for external symbols. Initially, GOT entries for functions point to glue code that triggers lazy loading.
  - On the first call to a function (like `fprintf`), the glue code asks the loader to resolve the symbol’s real address, which is then placed into the GOT. Subsequent calls use this direct address, eliminating extra indirection.
- **Copy Relocation:**
  - Data fields (like `stdout`) are relocated immediately when the executable is loaded.
  - The actual data ends up in the executable’s address space, so code can reference it directly without going through the GOT indirection.
- **Lazy Loading (Lazy Binding):**
  - The GOT starts with “glue code” rather than the final addresses.
  - This allows the executable to load quickly, only resolving symbols when they’re actually used.
