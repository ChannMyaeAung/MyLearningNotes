# Exercises 

1. Write a program that uses both the C library to read a number and the `libmymath.so` library to find the factorial of the number. Be
   sure to set the environment variables so the loader can find the library before you run it.

`use_mymath.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

long factorial(long n);
void printstuff();

int main()
{
    long num = 5;
    fprintf(stdout, "The factorial of %ld is %ld\n", num, factorial(num));
    printstuff();
}
```

`factorialfunc.s`

```assembly
.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
.globl factorial
.section .text

# this is the offset into the stack frame (%rbp) that we store the number for which we are taking the factorial.
.equ LOCAL_NUM, -8

factorial:
    # we will reserve space for 1 variable - the value we were called with
    # aligned to 16 bytes
    enter $16, $0

    # if the arg is 1 or 0, then return the result as 1.
    # otherwise, continue 
    cmpq $1, %rdi
    je base_case
    cmpq $0, %rdi
    je base_case

    # save the arg into our stack storage
    movq %rdi, LOCAL_NUM(%rbp)

    # call factorial with %rdi decreased by one
    decq %rdi
    call factorial 

    # the result will be in %rax. Multiply the result by our first arg we stored on the stack
    mulq LOCAL_NUM(%rbp)

    # result is in %rax which is what is needed for the return value
    leave 
    ret

base_case:
    # return 1
    movq $1, %rax
    leave 
    ret
```

`printstuff.s`

```assembly
.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
.globl printstuff 
.section .data 
mytext: 
    .ascii "hello there\n\0"

.section .text 
printstuff: 
    enter $0, $0 

    movq stdout@GOTPCREL(%rip), %rdi 
    movq (%rdi), %rdi 

    # Load the address of the string into %rsi using pc-relative addressing
    leaq mytext(%rip), %rsi 
    call fprintf@plt # call fprintf using the PLT 

    leave 
    ret 
```

`multbyten.s`

```assembly
.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
.globl multbyten

.section .data 
ten:
    .quad 10

.section .text 
multbyten: 
    movq ten(%rip), %rax
    imulq %rdi # multiply result by n (result = n * 10)
    ret 
```

`squareme.s`

```assembly
.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
.globl squareme 

.section .text 
squareme: 
    movq %rdi, %rax 
    imulq %rdi 
    ret 
```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ gcc -shared printstuff.s multbyten.s squareme.s factorialfunc.s -o libmymath.so
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ gcc -rdynamic use_mymath.c -lmymath -L . -o use_mymath
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly/square$ ./use_mymath
The factorial of 5 is 120
hello there
```
