# Dynamic Linking

- **Recall:** 
  - With dynamic linking, libraries stay as separate files, and they are **merely referenced** by our code.
  - They are only brought together when our program is run. 
  - Thus, the libraries can be upgraded separately from the applications.
  - The individual functions are not copied into each application program but only exist in one place in the filesystem. These libraries are called **shared libraries**.
  - On Linux, they are known as **shared objects** and have the extension `.so`.
  - On Windows, they are known as **dynamic link libraries** and have the extension `.dll`.
  - On Mac, they are **dynamic libraries** and have the extension `.dylib`.
