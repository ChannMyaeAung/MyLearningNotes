# ROL (rotate left) and ROR (rotate right)

- Both are bit-manipulation instructions in assembly that shift all bits in an operand in a circular fashion.
- Unlike standard shift operations, which move bits and fill the vacated positions with zeros, rotate instructions "wrap around" the bits that fall off one end, reintroducing them at the opposite end.

---

## ROL

- Shifts all bits of the operand to the left by a specified count. 

- Bits shifted out of the most significant end (left side) are reinserted at the least significant end (right side)

- **Example**:

  - If we have an 8-bit value `10110011` and execute `ROL` by 3 positions:

  ```css
  Original:   10110011
  After ROL3: 10011101
  ```

  - Here, the leftmost 3 bits (`101`) are wrapped around to the right side.

## ROR

- Shifts all bits of the operand to the right by a specified count. 

- Bits shifted out of the least significant end (right side) are reinserted at the most significant end (left side).

- **Example**:

  ```css
  Original:   10110011
  After ROR2: 11101100
  ```

  - The rightmost 2 bits (`11`) are wrapped around to the left side.

  

  The instruction `ror $16, %rax` would result rotating the value 2 bytes (16 bits) to the right.

  ```css
  Original: 's' 'i' 's' 'i' 'h' 'T'
  After ROR2: 'h' 'T' 's' 'i' 'i' 'i'
  ```
