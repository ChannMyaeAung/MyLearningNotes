# Exercises

1. Create a program that finds the youngest age in the array.

```assembly
.section .data
ages:
	.quad 25, 34, 19, 45, 18   
count:
	.quad 5

.section .text
.globl _start
_start:
	# Set up a pointer to the beginning of the array in %rsi
	lea ages(%rip), %rsi
	
	# Load the count from memory into %rcx
	movq count(%rip), %rcx      # %rcx now holds the number of elements (5)
	
	# Assume the array is not empty.
	# Load the first element into %rax as our initial "youngest" value.
	movq (%rsi), %rax           # %rax = ages[0] (25)

	# decrement count by 1.
	dec %rcx                    # Now %rcx = count - 1
	
	# Advance the pointer to the second element.
	addq $8, %rsi               # Move pointer to next 64-bit element

loop_start:
	# If no more elements, finish.
	cmpq $0, %rcx
	je done
	
	# Load the current element into %rdx.
	movq (%rsi), %rdx           # %rdx = current age
	
	# Compare the current youngest in %rax with the current age in %rdx.
	cmpq %rdx, %rax             # Compare: youngest (%rax) ? current (%rdx)
	jle skip             # Jump if %rax <= %rdx
	
	# Otherwise, update the youngest age.
	movq %rdx, %rax             # New youngest = current age

skip:
	# Move to the next element in the array (each element is 8 bytes).
	addq $8, %rsi
	
	# Decrement the loop counter.
	dec %rcx
	jmp loop_start

done:
	# The youngest age is now in %rax.
	# Exit the program with that value as the exit code.
	# Note: Linux exit status uses only the low 8 bits.
	movq %rax, %rdi             # Move youngest age to %rdi (exit code)
	
	# Invoke the exit system call.
	movq $60, %rax              # Syscall number for exit (60)
	syscall

```

```sh
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ as findyoungest.s -o findyoungest.o
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ld findyoungest.o -o findyoungest
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ ./findyoungest
chan@CMA:~/C_Programming/Assembly$ echo $?
18
```

2. Modify the previous program so that, after finding the youngest age in the array, it gives back the index of the record with that age, rather than the age itself.

```assembly
```

```sh
```
