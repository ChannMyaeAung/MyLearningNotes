# Other instruction families

- There are several instruction families that can help with endianness and similar byte-oriented operation.

**xchg**: 

- Swaps the contents of two operands (registers or a register and memory).

- Useful for exchanging values without using a temporary register.

  ```assembly
  xchg %rax, %rbx  # Swap the values in %rax and %rbx
  ```

  

**bswap**:

- Reverses the byte order of a register (commonly used on 32‑bit and 64‑bit registers).

- Often used for converting between little-endian and big-endian representations.

  ```assembly
  bswap %eax     # Reverses the bytes in the 32-bit register %eax
  ```

  

**shr (shift right)**:

- Shifts the bits in the operand to the right by a specified number of positions.

- Inserts zeros into the high-order bits.

- Commonly used for unsigned division by powers of two.

  ```assembly
  shr $1, %rax   # Shift %rax right by one bit (divides an unsigned number by 2)
  ```

  

**shl (shift left)**:

- Shifts the bits in the operand to the left by a specified number of positions.
- Inserts zeros into the low-order bits.
- Used for multiplying a value by powers of two.

```assembly
shl $1, %rax   # Shift %rax left by one bit (multiplies the value by 2)
```
