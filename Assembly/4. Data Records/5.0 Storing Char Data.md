# Storing Character Data

- Just like we can declare data of various sizes in assembly language, we can also declare textual data.
- To declare a bit of data as ASCII text, we use the `.ascii` directive.

```assembly
mytext:
	.ascii "This is a string of characters.\0"
```

- `mytext` is a label that refers to the memory address of the first character in the string.
- Capital letters start at 65, lowercase letters start at 97, and spaces are represented by the code 32.
- We can actually write a character as a value in an assembly listing using single quotes.
  - E.g. If we want to load the ASCII code for the letter `a` into `%al`, we can do it with `movb $'a', %al`.
  - If we don't use the dollar sign, the assembler will think we are referring to the memory location at address 97.
