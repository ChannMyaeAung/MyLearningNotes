# Including Strings in Data Records

- Use the `.asciz` or `.string` directive to create a null-terminated string.

```assembly
    .section .data
my_string:
    .asciz "Hello, World!"
```

- Use the `.ascii` directive if one don't want an automatic null terminator:

```assembly
    .section .data
my_string:
    .ascii "Hello, World!"
```



- Fixed length fields.
  - We reserve 32 bytes for the name string.

```assembly
people:
	.ascii "Issac Newn\0"
	.quad 250, 10, 4, 70, 11
endpeople:

.globl NAMEOFFSET, WEIGHT_OFFSET, SHOE_OFFSET
.globl HAIR_OFFSET, HEIGHT_OFFSET, AGE_OFFSET
.equ NAME_OFFSET, 0
.equ WEIGHT_OFFSET, 32
.equ SHOE_OFFSET, 40
.equ HAIR_OFFSET, 48
.equ HEIGHT_OFFSET, 56
.equ AGE_OFFSET, 64
.globl PERSON_RECORD_SIZE
.equ PERSON_RECORD_SIZE, 72
```

- It has problems, such as imposing maximum size on the name.
- We can't simply support names longer than 31 characters.
- Plus, for short names, we are wasting space.
  - If the name is "Smith", we've wasted a lot of space holding that name.
- To solve this, the alternative way of storing the names is to store them **as pointers**.
- We will store the names themselves elsewhere, where we can allocate the exact amount of space we need, and then store in the record itself the memory address where that string lives.

```assembly
.section .data
.globl people, numpeople
numpeople:
	# calculate the number of people in array
	.quad (endpeople - people) / PERSON_RECORD_SIZE

people:
	.quad $inname, 250, 10, 4, 70, 11
endpeople: # mark the end of the array of calculation purposes

inname:
	.ascii "Issac Newn\0"

.globl NAME_PTR_OFFSET, WEIGHT_OFFSET, SHOE_OFFSET
.globl HAIR_OFFSET, HEIGHT_OFFSET, AGE_OFFSET
.equ NAME_PTR_OFFSET, 0
.equ WEIGHT_OFFSET, 8
.equ SOE_OFFSET, 16
.equ HAIR_OFFSET, 24
.equ HEIGHT_OFFSET, 32
.equ AGE_OFFSET, 40
.globl PERSON_RECORD_SIZE
.equ PERSON_RECORD_SIZE, 48
```

- The drawback is a bit inefficient.
- Rather than being able to load a character with a single instruction, we have to first load the address of the string into a register and then load the character offset. 
- For instance, we could issue the instruction `movq NAME_PTR_OFFSET(%rbx), %rdx` to load the address of the string into `%rdx` and then do `movb(%rdx,%rcx,1), %al` to get the character at the index specified by `%rcx` into `%al`. 
- Pointers in x86-64 are quadwords.
