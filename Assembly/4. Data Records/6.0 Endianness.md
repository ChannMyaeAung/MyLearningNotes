# Endianness

- Defines the order in which bytes of a multi-byte data type (16, 32, or 64 bit integer) are stored in memory.

## Little-Endian

- The least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lowest memory address. (LSB = rightmost bit, represents the smallest value)
- Let's say we have:

`10000000 11011111 111111110`

This would be stored in memory as the following byte sequence:

1. 11111110
2. 11011111
3. 10000000

Little-endian because the "little end" (LSB) is stored first.



## Big-Endian

- The most significant byte (MSB) is stored at the lowest memory address.
- Also called "network byte order" because of its predominance in networking protocols.

1. 10000000
2. 11011111
3. 11111110

The x86-64 instruction set architecture is a little endian instruction set.
